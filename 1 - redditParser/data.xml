    <text>&gt; how can someone borrow more than 100% of the shares (in case of GME and Melvin)?

A loaned out share can be loaned again. Imagine we both have a share, you can borrow and short sell one of my shares to me and I can borrow and sell one of your shares to you, and we can do that over and over again. (actually the other commenter's example with 3 ppl makes more sense). In reality it's way more interconnected and complicated than that though.

&gt; If GME really rockets, how could the shorts possibly re-buy?

Whoever actually owned the original shares (somebody has to originally own them) can basically extort the short sellers with insane sell prices. That's a short squeeze, since the subsequent extortion will add more pressure onto shorts to sell.

&gt; Don't we have a broken market in our hands now?

Yeah kinda, GME is not at all being properly valued right now. Short term inefficiencies in the market like this always happen, but this is extreme enough that it might prompt regulations into how much one can short sell.</text>

    <text>What I don’t get is it seems like instead of saying I’ll pay $5000, it’s I’ll pay market so you wind up getting $5. When it’s obvious the future is dim, seems like you just want to sell that ps5 instead of loan.</text>

    <text>more than 100% of the shares can be shorted for the same reason you can deposit money into a bank from someone who got a loan and the bank can then lend against that lent money you deposited  


Someone buys a stock. Another person asks to borrow it and immediately sells it to a third guy. If only one stock exists 100% of available shares are now shorted, but the third guy can loan his stock he bought to a fourth guy who then shorts it and sells it to a fifth. now you have one stock, two short positions, and three stockholders, with a 200% short rate.  


if the stock price rises, both shorters are obligated to buy back as many stocks as they borrowed at market price and pay interest for the stock loan. Two guys are now trying to buy one stock to get out of their short position and they aren't really allowed to wait for a better price.  


In the case of gamestops shares, the fifth guy looked into things and figured out what was going on, jacking the asking price of his stock sky high in anticipation the two shorters would have to pay it. even if it was overvalued.</text>

    <text>But here's what I don't understand. Based on what I've heard about shorting a stock, the stock will continue to lose its value. That's the whole point, right? I borrow stocks so that I can sell it high, buy it low, pocket the difference, and then give it back to the original lender.

But even if the original lender is paid some interest... aren't they getting back a shittier, less valuable stock?

If I lend my PS5 to a friend with a $100 return fee, and he lends it out 5 more times, sure I'll make $100 by the end of the year, but I'll have a broken, dirty, cheeto-dusted PS5 by the end of it.

How is this beneficial to the original lender?</text>

    <text>That's assuming you will have the 5000 next year. This makes it somewhat clearer though, thank you. But when did I agree to this? Or is it an unwritten rule/terms and conditions thing from broker apps that borrowed stock gets repayed? How do i know if my stock was borrowed, or does it not work that way and the "shorter" is forced to buy stocks thus "repaying" me by increasing the stock value?
Sorry for all the questions mr.baconator, this is just fascinating.</text>

    <text>It's  u/deepfuckingvalue. Not sure of the specifics but here's the general jist. 


Back in late 2019 he was looking through stock options and found that GME (GameStop) had alot of shorts on it. Meaning the hedge funds were betting the stock price was going down and the company was going bankrupt. He saw this and thought you would make the opposite bet. He has been posting his updates on his gamble I think weekly now daily on WSB. 


At first the initial reaction was he was stupid and retarted, and that's normal. The sub was filled with yolo bets and huge loss porn before this whole fiasco started. No one thought anything of it until a few months ago. Gamestop got a new CEO and management that came from a successful online company (Chewy). They had a sold plan to turn the company around and everyone started jumping on board. 


Starting around December WSB started slowly supporting him and buying GME shares. I think it was about a week ago where the sub was unified on GME.


Look though his post history and read though some of the comments. It swings from him being a retard to a genius. He started with I think 50k and peaked on Wednesday with 50m. On Thursday he lost 20m in potential profits, and is still holding!</text>

    <text>It is theoretically possible to short more than 100% of the shares, but any stock that has a short interest of more than 20-25% is considered highly volatile and risky. 

That being said, the reason GSE is shorted so highly is because the hedge funds thought the shares would go to 0 as the company goes bankrupt, and as a result, the shares will have a value of $0. Hence, they can short an infinite amount of shares, as long as the expected future price is $0. 

Seems stupid no?</text>

    <text>GME is actually a perfect example, there was something like 90% of float owned by institutions in various funds. If they didn’t allow their longs to be loaned out there wouldn’t have been this event.</text>

    <text>Are there any restrictions on how many times that $1 can be borrowed?

Because in theory, that $1 can be borrowed ad infinitum, resulting in 100s or 1,000s or 1,000,000s all borrowing the same $1.</text>

    <text>I want to short the stock. I borrow 10 shares and sell them to Sally. Sally holds them in her account that allows loaning the shares. I borrow them from Sally and sell them to Frank. Now I'm short 20. Frank takes those shares and holds them in an account that allows loaning to short sellers. I borrow them from Frank and sell them. I'm now 30 short but only 10 shares were ever touched. This can go on forever. 

The same thing happens on the unwind only in reverse.</text>

    <text>This is very clever, but I honestly think it's not an accurate analogy. The institutions and high net worth investors aren't your opponents running up the score against you; it's more like poker. You're a poker player, and so are they, But because they're high rollers, the casino opens early for them and stays open later for them. (Also, there are millions of players at millions of tables so it's not like any one of you is playing against any one of the others.)

(My own analogy isn't quite accurate either-- because of course stocks go up and down based on news &amp; world events, and so being able to trade over a longer hours [or 24/7 as you can do with private trades if you're one of the financial elites] can definitely be an advantage--but it's a hair closer to the truth imho.)</text>

    <text>It increases the number of sellers, while the number of buyers stays the same. So large volume (high no. of trades) can lower the price temporarily, but typically not for long as more buyers come in to push the price back to where it started</text>

    <text>A gamma squeeze isn't the same thing as a short squeeze. Short squeezes happen when short sellers drive up the price of stock as they try to exit their positions while there aren't enough shares available for trading. A gamma squeeze happens when market makers drive up the price of stock by trying to hedge option sales by owning the underlying stock.</text>

    <text>Selling shares makes the price go down. Buying makes it go up. Imagine there are 100s of people at a grocery store. The grocer brings out some fruit. You decide to buy an apple. You pay $1. The guy next to you wants an apple but there are none left. He offers you $2 for your apple. Buying like that makes the apples worth more because now $2 is the going rate.


Imagine instead the grocer brought out apples and nobody wanted them. He might lower his prices to entice people too buy. Selling or selling short is still just selling shares. Its all about supply and demand.</text>

    <text>&gt;They're the current front runners for dominating the electric car market which is rapidly growing. 

Eh, they're doing well, but it's not like they're running circles around legacy manufacturers. The best selling EV in the EU last year was the Renault Zoe, which went up 118%, while the Model 3 fell by 9%. It'll be really interesting to see how Tesla will fare against some proper competition.</text>

    <text>I’m still a little confused on how this benefits the lender.

They give their 10 shares valued at $200 away with the premise they’ll be getting 10 shares back, but in this example the 10 shares they get back are not valued at $150 and they’re out $50.

Does the practice of short selling artificially deflate the stocks value due to supply/demand balance? Effectively guaranteeing that the hedge fund will make some money, then once the artificial supply of stock vanishes when the loaned shares are bought back and returned to the lender, the increased trading of the stock artificially inflates demand, causing the stocks value to rebound back to the same value or higher than it was before the short trade started?

If I’m accurate in my interpretation, how is the practice of hedge funds short selling huge amounts of stock not considered market manipulation? 

Do these practices end up hurting the stock or the company they represent? Or do these practices actually stimulate the market by generating or renewing interest in the stock?

Is short selling usually small amounts of stock and is inherently risky to the short seller, kinda like buying/selling on the margins?

Thanks in advance to anyone who can help me wrap my head around this!</text>

    <text>No. The stock holders are the owners of small pieces of the company (their share of the company). Companies are supposed to make money for their shareholders. So you are buying a share of the profit when you buy the stock. If they make a lot of profit that means the share price will go up. If they dont, the share price will go down. The market is imperfect though and a lot has to do with how people feel about things which often has little to do with profit.</text>

    <text>Incentive, sure, but not as much--you don't make new money selling a stock that later goes down. Also, if you're already invested in that company, your incentive would be to sell the stock but keep it a secret why, until all your shares are sold.</text>

    <text>To expand on your first point, if you have the incentive to see a company fall, you'll skim through every page in their books to make sure their numbers are correct and not doing anything sketchy to keep their value artificially higher.

e.g. Acme Co. erroneously reported 1 million more sales this quarter than the previous. If everyone wanted to see them go up, who's going to call them out on that? If some folks want to see them burn, they probably will want to see how Acme Co. came up with that number.</text>

    <text>Generally no, but excluding a stock that you've always included when that stock is undergoing historic volatility is pretty borderline market manipulation. Especially when it's public knowledge that virtually 90% of retail investors (wallstreetbets) are using robin hood to trade GME, and they are fighting wallstreet.</text>

    <text>Rough timeline would be that people started buying months ago, over the summer. Fads come and go in the stock market. This one caught on because one guy on wsb (/u/deepfuckingvalue) made a big play and attracted some attention. It started going well which brought in more and more because the folks at wsb like to watch someone gamble with a million bucks on a old crappy stock. As more people piled in the stock went higher and higher and it sort of became a meme. Then they realized about 2 weeks ago that someone had a huge short position. Thats when it got serious and people realized they could mess with a hedge fund.</text>

    <text>&gt; is there a chance that after selling the first 100 shares, that would drive the price down for the remaining 900 shares, and by the time they are all sold I made far less that $10 per share?

Yes, that happens more in situations where few buyers and sellers exist for a given stock. The price of Apple, Walmart, Coca-Cola etc will vary very little in the scenario you describe, but companies with a relatively small number of shares in the hands of investors can be more volatile. As a result, portfolio managers and traders work on ways to minimize the negative price impact of their transacting.  Dark pools were developed as a way to allow those with large blocks of shares that they need to buy or sell to minimize the information they give others about their purchase/sale intentions (which can be enough to shift the terms against you).</text>

    <text>That depends on how you issue the order, you can do all at once or just push out 1000 shares and sell it for whatever. The latter one allows the possibility of you selling less or more than 10 per share. With all the tech it's usually sold in big blocks so 500 maybe 10 and the rest might be 9.50.</text>

    <text>Literally hundreds of choices to go with. Best are generally Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, Bitrix because they are biggest and have a lot of liquidity. I'd recommend Binance. It depends on where you live, too. For the average person who doesn't want to educate themselves fully on the process, you can buy via PayPal or Square, but I assume the fees are higher. Never used them so not positive on that.

    <text>You own 5shares and your mom owns another 5, they are all shares that exist. So a total of 5. 

I think the shares are overvalued so I borrow your 5shares, then sell them in hope that I can buy them back later for a cheaper price. When I sell them I do it to someone, let’s say your dad that wants to get in on the action. After a while I want to short more so I repeat the action with your moms 5shares. Now you and your mom own 5 shares each that you have lent out to me. I own some money and has a debt of 10shares total. Your dad owns 10shares.

I can then make the same deal again and borrow 4shares from your dad, and selling them back whoever. I would then own 14shares total even tho there are only 10 in existence. In a way I have borrowed the same share multiple times.</text>

    <text>So, I read that there is a difference between "market value" and "actual value," and that while GameStop's market value is great right now, that doesn't mean the company is doing well. I mean, the reason the hedge fund was shorting them in the first place was because they were doing so poorly.

So what happens to GameStop the company? Why does their market value not have an impact on the business itself? And what happens if GameStop were to declare bankruptcy, let's say tomorrow?</text>

    <text>The market determines the price. No different than if I showed up at your house with an Iphone and said I want to sell this to you for $500 and you said no I thinks it's $450 and I said deal. The price is $450 then. 

This will not have an effect on actual Gamestop stores.</text>

    <text>To apply an analogy to your last point, the stock market is rigged in the same way basketball is. I'm a pudgy 5'8 guy, I can't possibly compete with NBA players because they are both inherently more suited to playing the game and have put a lot more time and energy into getting good at it. The rules of basketball aren't designed so that I have a better chance of competing with NBA players, they're designed so the game functions better. The same is true of the stock market.</text>

    <text>The market itself is what determines the price.

As in.. you bring a share of your company to a group of people and say that you will sell the share for $5. The group of people offer you $4.50, $4.60 and $4.90.

You accept $4.90. The price of the stock is $4.90.

It will impact them if they own stock. It could also impact them if Gamestop's ownership sell more shares at the higher price, then use that new money to affect change for the Gamestop employees.</text>

    <text>RH is not allowed to just remove the ability to buy GME like this, and only make it possible to sell. They did this because they direct 40% of their traffic to Citadel, the same company that funds one of the major hedge funds that shorted the stock. There is already a class action lawsuit and it's probably illegal.</text>

    <text>Okay, I think I get it now.  So when they initially sell the stock, they didn't actually pay the original owner the $1500, but instead literally borrowed it to sell at the current market price, hoping that it would fall further and they could return the lower-valued stock to the original owner.  They sold something they didn't own at the higher price, then had to buy it back at a cheaper price and return it.  Is that more or less the gist of it?

Thanks, by the way!</text>

    <text>Links to studies about short sale ban? What I’ve seen is that having shorts allowed increases liquidity. 

Think about it this way: if a fund manage has a bunch of long stock that they have to keep, *not* loaning it out to shorts would reduce the number of shares for other people.</text>

Well the share was $5 over the summer and when all of this is said and done, the price will probably be close to it, BUT without all that short volume, so lets say $20. So yes, it will be better for GME, their stock and ability to raise capital will likely go up.

    <text>it does, however it's also likely that hedge funds will be on the lookout and avoid situations where this can occur. Part of the reason this happened was because the hedge funds who shorted GME didn't expect to get squeezed out by the public. Usually short squeezes happen because of rival hedge funds.</text>

    <text>The interest is the only “fixed” or known cost.  It’s basically the price someone pays someone to borrow the stocks.  It’s usually pretty low, based on the time frame for repayment...I’ll skip the Black-Scholes mathematics for now.   The real money comes with the amount the price changes between the borrow and repayment date.  And stocks that have normally large price fluctuations usually account for that in the price of the contract.</text>

    <text>It’s not mean-spirited. It’s creating a competitive market.

Hedge fund managers have been shorting GameStop for years. They got complacent investing tons of money on a fail-safe short. (Ie. there’s no way that it won’t stop dropping) so they pumped a ton of money into it. These hedge funds (and their managers) essentially own wealth conglomeration as the markets live and die by their hand.

WSB and others chose to battle the Goliath at their own game. Hedge fund managers continued to gouge at its corpse for years, the little guy breathed some life (read: capital) into the stock (a RETAIL stock no less) and won big on jt.

Now it’s a game of chicken, technically it’s only gambling with value right now... until there is a major sell off on either side. 

If enough of the little guys hold the stock for long enough, the hedge fund managers have been beaten at their own game and, in theory, wealth has been redistributed from the evil empire into the hands of a larger, presumably less wealthy, base

    <text>On average that would likely hurt the market. 

In the dot com bubble 3com issued some shares of its cellphone subsidiary palm. After the spinoff 3coms value was so low compared to palm that its remaining shares in palm were worth more than 3com itself. This would have opened up a potentially risk free trade if you were to go long 3com and short palm but finding shares to short from palm was near impossible and if you could find them they would have insane interest rates for borrowing. It may have been possible to reduce the volatility and pop of the dot com bubble if shorting shares was easier and cheaper.</text>

    <text>Yes, it is illegal to do it, except nobody enforces the law, and most hedge funds get away with it when their gamble goes the way they expected.

The problem is that these are “derivatives” which means they are “derived” from actual assets.  So while a single share of a stock is a real thing, these people just borrow it on paper, forgetting it’s an actual real thing that needs to be returned and not just some numbers on a spreadsheet.  It’s less about actually borrowing an actual stock and more about just creating a bunch of contracts.  If the stock price dropped, closing our those contracts is a snap, but if the price goes up, it becomes more and more expensive to close out all those contracts because you have to give 100% of the stocks back to the owners, PLUS you’ve got to buy back those stocks again from those same owners to pay back the other 50% you owe. So the price keeps going up and up as you try to buy the stocks to return to the owner and close out the contract while your losses keep going up and up.</text>

Don't they know the borrowers are betting on that stock to lose money?  And if that's the case, why wouldn't they just want to sell it themselves before the stock price drops and get a bigger return?  Or are they betting on the price to go up?   Or are they planning to keep the stock long term anyways and they don't care, so long as the stock is returned?</text>

    <text>&gt;I wrote this in another comment but here's my take on short selling (I'm learning as I go too).  
&gt;  
&gt;I always thought it was bad but then saw a documentary where basically it explained the good side. It basically gives other people a profit motive to figure out if your company is bullshitting, faking numbers, lying to investors, aren't actually stable, have bad management or has a bad future prospective, etc.  Think of Enron. So it gives motivation for the "value" of a company to be more scrutinized and accurate. Companies have motivation to look as good as possible and distort their image, books, value, etc. Like of course you'd want your stock to increase in value forever and be high; the CEO and others make bank that way too. You'd always want your company to seem "great", even if behind the scenes, it's actually not. So short sellers in a way can keep this system more "honest" by being a counter, or force with a lot of "punching power" to make sure it's all correct. Small folks like us can't affect the price as much (usually, well here we are lol) but big institutions can.  Of course, greed is on both sides and it can all be fairly amoral and shady and there's a bunch of companies all playing games with each other.</text>

    <text>For question 2, that's essentially right. In the case of gamestop, the way hedge funds are betting they are borrowing a stock from someone and selling the stock. 

The bet is that the stock goes down in price so that when the owner of the stock wants it back, the borrower has to buy the stock back at its current price and give it back to the owner. If the stock was initially sold at $10, but dropped down to $5, the borrower made $5.</text>

    <text>Pieces of paper that represent partial ownership of a company. In many cases, if you are a shareholder, you may get a say in certain decisions about the company's future. If the company is doing really well, the shareholders may get a cut of the profit the company makes. 

A company can basically go "We've got 10,000 partial ownerships available. If you buy them from us, you're a partial owner. Then, you can buy and sell and trade your ownership as you see fit."  


If the company is doing well, people may be willing to pay you more than you originally invested to take your place as a partial owner. If the company is doing poorly, you may try to sell your ownership quickly while there still may be some interest in it. Stock Markets make trading, buying and selling these shares in companies a lot easier.</text>

    <text>Stock prices are based on how rare (How many are in circulation) and the value of the stock itself (how likely is the company to do well? Is the profits more stable or random? Things like that), if they sold stock, for starters as the price goes up they miss out on the higher sell price, but secondly, the stock price itself goes down as less people seem to want the stock, which is exactly what the guys who bet Gold and are getting Grapes want, because of what I said above.
I'm no expert, so I might be 100% wrong but that's my take.</text>

    <text>Redditors made the stock go up by simply buying it from other stock holders!  If you have 100 shares of Stock G and its sells at $100, and I want to buy it from you, I have to offer you something slightly higher than the $100 price, say $101.  So when more people want to own the stock, the price keeps rising.  The price drops when more people want to sell it than buy it and vice versa.

Borrowing is exactly that.  A stock is a physical real asset.  It entitles you to own a portion of a company.  It can be “borrowed” just like a set of hedge clippers!  The key is that you borrow a fixed number of shares, but the price constantly changes.   So let’s say your neighbor bought a brand new set of hedge clippers from Home Depot for $100.  You ask to borrow his clippers, but you see there is a sale at HD for the same clippers for $80 starting next week.  So you quickly return the clippers to HD (let’s say the receipt is still in the box) and get $100, and then return to HD in a few days, but the pair for $80 and return the clippers to your neighbor and keep the $20.

Instead of garden tools, you borrow the shares, which gives you ownership of them and allows you to trade/buy/sell them, but the contract says you need to return the shares (any shares really, they’re all essentially identical) to your neighbor in a few days.</text>

    <text>So the extent of the gamma squeeze is that 100k shares will be bought tomorrow. Given that GME trading volume has been in the millions each day for the past week or so, won't the gamma squeeze be relatively insignificant? Like sure, it'll bump the price up a little bit, but it doesn't seem like it'll be enough to have a noticeable effect towards triggering the short squeeze.</text>

    <text>I always thought it was bad but then saw a documentary where basically it explained the good side. It basically gives other people a profit motive to figure out if your company is bullshitting, faking numbers, lying to investors, aren't actually stable, etc.  Think of Enron. So it gives motivation for the "value" of a company to be more scrutinized and accurate. Companies have motivation to look as good as possible and distort their image, books, value, etc. Like of course you'd want your stock to increase in value forever and be high; the CEO and others make bank that way too. You'd always want your company to seem "great", even if behind the scenes, it's actually not. So short sellers in a way can keep this system more "honest" by being a counter, or force with a lot of "punching power" to make sure it's all correct. Small folks like us can't affect the price as much but big institutions can.  Of course, greed is on both sides and it can all be fairly amoral and shady and there's a bunch of companies all playing games with each other.</text>

    <text>Wallstreetbets are saying this is war because the hedge funds and big money are playing dirty and doing illegal stuff to beat wallstreetbets people off. 

First of all, I read the reason the stock was shorted 140% is likely because hedge funds were doing naked shorting which illegal. When things started to look bad, hedge funds didn't back and started to double down on doing more shorting to push price down because they didn't like the idea of little guys retail investors beating them at their own game.

When that didn't work, they started spreading lies in mainstream media to make themselves look like the good guys and the wallstreetbets guys like bullies even though they are the ones trying to bankrupt a company and put people out of jobs. 

When that didn't work, they sent in bots and shills to infiltrate wallstreetbets to distract and scare people off. That's why you see all these other stocks being pumped to distract money away from GameStop.  This is to make the wallstreetbets people look like pump and dump scammers. 

Then they pushed discord to shut down the wallstreetbets discord server because 'racism' or 'hate speech' or some other BS. Also had some mainstream publication publish articles saying wallstreetbets is associated with alt right groups. They had to retract the articles very quickly when people started complaining. 

Meanwhile, they are lying or falsely suggesting they have already covered their shorts and got out of GameSpot stocks but people can tell from market data that shorts is still higher than 100% so they are still in. And after losing billions, they got bailed out by an even bigger company and then added more shorts. 

Then they started pushing share price down by doing fake sell in something called a short ladder. Essentially they are selling a few shares back and forth to themselves, lowering the price each time. This creates the appearance of stock price crashing, especially when they do it after hours when regular retail investors can't buy or sell. 

The final straw was today when the stock price was at all time high near $350, suddenly multiply stock broker platforms (Robinhood being most well know) locked users out and prevent people from buying. Users can sell but not buy stocks while hedge funds and institutions can buy the stocks on the cheap. There is also reports of them raising the margin requirements on shares bought on margin suddenly which forced some users into margin call. That allowed the brokers to forcibly sell user's stock without their approval and at a low price.

This crashed the stock price to around $120 and allowed the shortest to exit some of their positions on the cheap.

This made people all over the world very very angry and calling it a blatantly illegal move to manipulate the market. Now politician in both Democratic and Republican parties in US are calling for investigations into the stock market manipulation, although the anger is mostly directed at Robinhood and missing whoever the puppet master is. 

So now all that has spilled far out to the world with small investors all over the world buying and holding GameSpot shares in an effort to force the hedge funds and big institution shorter to capitulate. And the hedge funds are digging in their heels because they want to beat the retail investors back down so the little guys will never dare to try something like this again. 

So this is what they mean when they say it's a class war. It's open warfare on the stock market between the little guys against the 1%. The whole story is an amazing saga. I have never been so riveted by a stock market story before and never spent so much time checkjng stock price in my life before.

I would highly encourage anyone that can afford it to buy and hold a few GameSpot shares to help wallstreetbets guys. It's like fantasy football with stocks but more fun.</text>

    <text>The idea is that an investor can use this to reduce volatility in their portfolio.

If you are long on a stock (expect it to go up) you might also short another stock (expect it to go down) in the same industry so that when that industry goes down, you don't go down as far.</text>

    <text>It’s not really an infinite loop, as much as a positively increasing feedback loop.  Since Melvin borrowed more shares than actually exist, how are they going to return all those stocks?  Let’s say the company has 1 million outstanding shares, and they borrow all of them plus about 500,000 that they “borrow” because it’s just a paper contract.  So when they return the shares they really just have to close out the contracts.  If the price drops, they can buy 1 million shares, return them to the lenders, then buy 500,00 more from the market as the price continues to drop.   They can do this because as soon as they return the share to someone they can buy the stock back immediately from the lender, who will gladly sell a tanking stock.

But the opposite happened and now they need to buy back 1.5m shares of a stock that continues to rise in price.  But you can’t simply buy back 1.5 million shares from the market if only 1 million exist.  So even if you did manage to buy all 1 million shares to close out the contracts, you still need to buy another 500,000 to close out the contracts, and the only people you can buy from are the people you just returned their stock to!  So you need to buy those additional stocks back, all the while the price keeps going up and up, in order to close out all those contracts.  Theoretically, the very last stock that you have to buy to close out the very last contract could be infinitely high.  Like an asymptote on an exponential curve...the price just goes to ludicrous levels and you’ll probably at some point just default on the contract and pay some hefty penalties to do so...</text>

    <text>Assuming no abuse, it provides monetary incentives for people to investigate companies for fraud or actual financial issues. Not all companies are healthy, so some stocks will end up going down. If you do stock research, you will eventually find some companies are probably going downhill, and it allows you to have a way to bet downward stock price instead of up.</text>

    <text>Traditionally you might invest in a company by buying shares in it. If the company is doing well, those shares will pay out dividends - a portion of the net profits that the company makes. A lot of things can determine whether a company is doing well or badly. Those conditions will affect the dividend payments from the shares. This is how long term investors make a regular reliable income owning bits of companies.

Traders make their money by buying undervalued shares and waiting for them to increase in price before selling them on. When the stock is no longer undervalued, demand for new buys will slow down, and the share price will settle. This is how the market, using the "wisdom of the crowd" finds the optimal value of a company.

However if you are only allowed to bet on shares going up in price, nobody is rewarded for being pessimistic about a company. If a stock is overvalued there's nothing the traders can do, so it's in their interest to either keep quiet about any negative news, or just wait it out.

The idea is that if people are allowed to bet that a share price will fall, then the market will be able to settle on an accurate valuation much quicker. It's in everyone's interest that stocks are accurately valued, because this is a much better way of assessing a companies performance than having to do all that research yourself. Instead you can rely on undervalued company stocks going up and overvalued company stocks going down, all because of smart traders trying to make short term gains. When the optimistic traders and pessimistic traders balance out, then the company is valued properly.

So the ability to short stocks is a way to keep the market agile and accurate in the short term, as well as the long term.</text>

    <text>The lender gets a small fee for lending the shares out.  That’s basically the interest on the loan.  If I gave you $100 and you promised to return $100 back to me in a week with a $5 fee, I’d lend you it, assuming I got a contract that guarantees it.

For the borrower, it’s easy money...because they think it’s a sure thing that the price will drop, so they see it as risk-free free money.  I borrow a share from you, sell it at today’s price for $100, wait for the price to drop and buy it back from someone for $50.  I made $50, and then return the share back with the small interest fee.</text>

    <text>It’s controversial. Some people say it just allows for market manipulation - you take a short position and then make public statements about how the company you are short selling sucks.

Other people argue that it helps makes markets more efficient by allowing more trades to happen - it’s just as valuable to know that people are taking the view that the share price is going to fall as it is that people are taking the view that its going to go up.</text>

    <text>You've got the gist of it right.

In practice, short sellers (in your example: you), have to keep a certain amount of money in a margin account. If the price of pillows skyrockets and it looks like you won't be able to purchase another pillow, the other party can just seize your margin account. This is a margin call. Your other option is to pump more money in your margin account, to convince your lender that you have enough money to buy a pillow back.

This margin account is just there to make sure your lender isn't completely screwed if you're unable to buy your pillow back. Kinda like insurance on their part.

tl;dr yes, you'd be in trouble</text>

    <text>Under normal circumstances, you can't owe more than you paid. If you bought a share of ExampleCo for $3, you could earn money if ExampleCo starts to do really well, and now becomes popular and people are willing to pay you $10 for your share in that company. 

Or, if the CEO of ExampleCo is found to be a puppy-kicking jerk, the company might become a lot less popular, and people would only pay you $1 for that stock, and you've effectively lost $2.   


The current situation that is hurting big financial companies is a complicated thing that normal people don't have to worry about.</text>

    <text>So let's see if I can explain stocks to a theoretical 5 year old.

A company is a group of people who perform a task that other people like. These other people pay them money to perform this task. This money is used in 3 ways. First to pay the companies people a salary and maintain the machines. Second to buy new machines. And third the leftover money is given to the person owning the company as profit.

The second part of buying machines is expensive. Also it needs to happen before the machines can be used to perform more tasks. In theory the owner would pay for the machines up front and get the profit later.

If the owner does not have enough money stock can be used. The owner creates a contract that gives the holder the right to receive   a small part of the profit later. This contract can then be sold to someone. This person would want to buy the contract if they believe the company will make a lot of profit later. The contract is called a stock.

The stock can be sold to someone else, trading the future promise of profit for an immediate sum of money. The price of a stock is therefore related to the future success people think the company will have. If the company becomes more successful the future profit will likely be better and therefore the stock will be more valuable.

In many companies the profits are okay, but the real value of a stock is made in the increase in its value. So you buy stocks because you believe the perception of this company will improve. The profits you receive are not that important to you. You buy the stock when the company is small and sell it when it's bigger/more successful.

But there is a risk. The company might become less successful. This makes the stock less valuable because there will be less profits.

So "betting" in the stock market is putting a lot of money in a stock because you think you know how the company will do. 

You can bet on a company doing worse. This is done by loaning someone else's stock. This person will want you to temporarily give him an amount of money in case you can't give back the stock later. This "collateral" is bigger if the stock is more valuable. So you loan a stock and sell it.... Now you can't give it back! But wait you have a plan. If you can buy back the stock later for less money you'll have a stock to give back. If you sold it for 20$ and buy it back later for 5$ you can keep the 15$ difference. You return the stock and get back your collateral. But if the 20$ stock becomes worth more the other person will want more collateral. Because the thing you loaned has become more valuable. If the collateral becomes too big for you to pay you're in trouble.</text>

    <text>The hedgefunds in general have a deadline because they borrowed a bunch of stock to do this trick, and the people they borrowed it from will start charging interest if they don't return them on time, so they're being heavily pressured to buy it soon before those deadlines hit.</text>

    <text>If Mr. Short can buy one stock he can give it to the guy he owes it to, Mr. Lender, so now he only owes Mr. Lender 149 instead of 150.

Then Mr. Lender is probably going to sell it because the stock is worth like 100x more than when he bought it. So he sells it.

Mr. Short buys it. Then he gives it straight back to Mr. Lender. He now owes 148 of his 150.

Repeat.

If no one at all is selling they just keep asking for a higher and higher price until someone breaks. Then people will likely start competing over who gets to sell and the price will tank.</text>

    <text>This is somewhat simplified, but the funds bet against GameStop by borrowing shares and selling them, and hoping to buy them back at lower prices.

However, in order to borrow GameStop shares, they had to set aside collateral. As the price of GameStop goes up, they have to put aside more and more collateral. Eventually the people who lend them the shares might say - “this shit is getting too crazy, we want our shares in GameStop back - buy them now, or we’ll take your collateral and buy the shares ourselves”. 

Though when that point is reached depends on how big that “loan” is. To use made up numbers, if the “loan” is only $10k and you’re worth $100M, I might be ok with you keeping it going as long as you put up collateral. If you’re only worth $15k, I’m gonna get nervous.</text>

    <text>This is the first time calls have been explained in a way that makes sense to me. Could you also explain puts?

Based on what you said, it seems that puts are the same kind of "coupon" you are buying to be able to sell a stock at a discounted price? But that's confusing because wouldn't you have to own the stock to be able to sell it?

Also, what is the rationale of allowing "coupons" to even be sold? It seems like they are literally lottery tickets by a different name. You are betting that one thing will happen and the seller is betting that it won't otherwise they wouldn't give the option. Or is there some intrinsic reason it actually makes sense to sell the option?</text>

    <text>So I get 10  bags of weed worth 100 schmeckels from mid level dealer on the promise I pay him (or her) in 2 days with the intention of selling it to my friends for 15 schmeckels a turn.

They only want to pay 5 schmeckles

So I then have to find 50 extra schmeckels or I get my legs broken in 2 days time.

My options become doubling down in the hope I can make that money back, or lose some of my other assets like a TV to fund the difference?</text>

    <text>Is there a set time when the calls expire?

I just bought my first stock today ever (and I'm old) but it was AMC and NOK because it was easier than trying to find somewhere to buy Gamestop. I finally signed up for SoFi and could buy but it was right before market close and I didn't want to rush a decision since I'm brand new.

Anyway, long story longer, tonight I'm regretting not rushing and I'm afraid that by the time I'm able to place an order in the a.m., the price will have peaked.</text>

    <text>&gt;But there’s no doubt that WSB is a big part of why this is all over the news and politicians are tweeting about it.

Which is the part I'm really interested about. Is reddit really the one to 'blame' for starting everything, and who deserves to be in the spotlight right now? Or are there much bigger and more truly influential players involved who are escaping attention by allowing reddit to be the scapegoat?

    <text>Yes, now what's even crazier with GME is there *are more apples shorted than even exist.* (people who borrowed apples, then lent them out, etc etc)
When the squeeze happens, there wont be enough apples to buy back, even though they have to. Driving the price to technically infinite. (if no one sells)</text>

    <text>This is more to confirm my suspicion, but please correct me if I’m wrong:

If market makers move to hedge shares in preparation for the expiring calls that are ITM, but there are no available shares due to other investors accumulating all of them, will this gamma squeeze have the same consequences as a short squeeze but on a much larger scale? If the stockholders hold, the price would just keep going up, correct? And then when the shorts cover, it would go even higher.</text>

    <text>Thank you - Im mostly following this. But why do they need to pay back what they borrowed now? Can’t they wait until it’s lower and just ride it out assuming that it will eventually fall again? Or is there a finite number of shares available and so when these new people wanted to purchase it, it had to come from the hedge funds who borrowed it?</text>

So what triggers a short squeeze? Surely they wouldn't cover their shorts while a gamma squeeze happens right? What prevents them from waiting out the gamma squeeze? Is there a specific date that shorts need to cover?</text>

    <text>Their short positions expires at a set time with which they agreed with their broker. Usually it has to do with options trading(I don't want to get into it because it's more complex). Options are expiring today and the highest strike price currently is $650. So if the price of gamestop closes above $650, they will have to buy all the options from $1 - $650 as they are "In the Money". One option is equivalent to 100 shares, which again drives up the price of the stock. THIS IS A NEVER ENDING LOOP. xD</text>

    <text>Yes, I agree on terminology for Gamma Squeeze. I think short dated OTM call option buying occurred for GME. But this hedging is constantly occurring. Market makers keep their books neutral to stock prices. Every option can be replicated thru stock and cash borrowing. delta is a measurement of the % change of option price relative to movements of underlying stock. market makers sum delta across strike prices and expiry dates for their options and then hedge the remainder by buying or shorting the stock. Gamma is a measurement of how much delta changes when the underlying stock prices moves. As a call moves in the money, gamma increases, forcing the market makers to buy more stock on already written options. This can be a gamma squeeze. 

In a sense short is similar in that shorts negative gamma. As the price increases, the %exposure to the stock and rate of change increase negative. The short position size gets even largely. This is why shorts can get out of hand quickly and suffer sharp losses for hedge funds.</text>

    <text>GME is a rocket. Brokers stopped purchases of GME. They did give a hint to what they are afraid will rocket soon, since they stopped purchases of NOK, BB, and AMC as well. Either they don't catch the hype and just die and you'll lose your money, or they will all get a big short term increase. I'm betting on the short term increase, but I don't know shit.</text>

    <text>&gt;How can there be more "short positions" than there are stocks? Because surely then you have to pay back more stocks than exist... which is impossible?

Literally, it's because nobody checked. The brokers just assumed the billionaire hedge funds were good for it.

&gt;How are the hedge funds able to not only speculate that the stocks will go down but also to actually make that happen? Like, how is that possible, but also how is that legal?

Because nobody made it illegal yet. That's about to change (somewhat).

&gt;And finally - how does the value of a company's stock falling translate to real world implications for the business? If these hedge funds had got their way, would GameStop have gone out of business, and would it have been their fault?

Yes. Companies with falling share prices have more difficulty raising capital.</text>

    <text>I have questions regarding how this might affect trading in the future. Say down the road, will it be possible for a hedge fund to CLAIM that they heavily shorted a stock, triggering a squeeze when in reality the bought / placed calls on the stock to capitalize on the price increase? Or are shorts / calls of that magnitude generally reported for all to see?</text>

    <text>Deadline Prime is tomorrow, All the call contracts expire tomorrow. a call contract is a contract with with a company to buy a set number of shares at a specific price. This is how /r/wallstreetbets has Hedge funds on the hook. 

Example: I hold a call contract that expires tomorrow for 100 shares of GME at 60$ a share. Right now GME is over 300$ a share but the contract STILL requires they sell my those shares a 60$ a piece. So i make 240 dollars per share difference. 100x240$ -&gt; boom 24,000$ in gains. The way the hedge fund wins in this scenario is for the price of GME to be near or below 60$ a share, because if its below 60$ there is no point in executing that contract. Why buy the shares a 60$ a piece if they cost 20$ a piece?

The crux of the hedge fund problem come from what is called an "Uncovered Call". Normally to make a call contract you need to own those 100 shares. But hedge funds be large cash on hand that they could cover it. An uncovered call is a contract that dosnt require the sell to own the shares which would be due in the contract.

The problem that is being exploited is 1) Hedge funds Citidel and Melvin, sold to many of these contracts while not owning enough shares. 2) There simply arent enough shares on the market. 

GME is a small company compared to many on wallstreet. There are a grand total of about 70 million shares that exist. 70 mill/100 share per contract means 70,000 contracts worth of shares exist. contracts were so cheap that people on /r/wallstreetbets literally have hundreds to thousands of them. Here is a person with a literal 1000's contracts worth. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l78uct/gme\_yolo\_update\_jan\_28\_2021/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l78uct/gme_yolo_update_jan_28_2021/) thats 1/70 of the total possible amount.

Now contracts expire tomorrow, which means all these contracts need to be paid out tomorrow. ***The Hedge funds are requires to sell them THOSE SHARES, They cant simply buy yours out, they have to sell you those shares***. So this means those same hedge funds need to buy shares to cover their contracts. This is what is driving the price so high. You have a TON of shares being held by so few people willing to sell them that he price is going astronomical. And still there arent enough, this is why they talk about the "infinite squeeze" because there is no selling out for some of these people and there arent enough shares to cover.

The fallout from all this is going to be most interesting thing tomorrow, because i think there is a chance we see some bankrupt hedge funds from this. Which will ultimately be bad or all sides, If they go into bankruptcy there nothing they can cover those contracts with tomorrow and they screw over the people holding those contracts. On top of which they will have liquidated all there assets to pay who they can which will screw over people that have any money in Melvin (which is a much smaller fund then they are making it out to be) Tomorrow is the Reckoning. its going to be rough</text>

    <text>WSB's endgame is that the last people to buy the stock at the very top are going to be the hedge funds trying to close out their short positions because they can't afford to keep losing money while also paying interest on the borrowed shares. These short sellers would have to exit their positions by buying the stock back on the open market to return to whomever they borrowed it from.

It's a plausible scenario. Undoubtedly, some retail investors will buy in at or near the top and get wiped out.</text>

    <text>Totally depends on the contract, but often there's no limit - the short seller just keeps paying interest. However, the broker/owner can do a "margin call" and force the short seller to give the stock back if they don't have enough money to cover potential future losses.</text>

    <text>&gt;How does buying and selling stocks work?

Buying and selling stocks is quite simple. A stock in a company has a certain price. The more people who buy that stock, the value of the stock goes up. Demand is increased, so price goes up. Conversely, if a lot of people sell a certain stock, the price goes down.

&gt;What is short selling?

Short selling is what you can do if you think the value of a stock is going to decrease. Here's how it works. Let's say you think stock XYZ is going to decrease in price within one month. You, through your broker, can short sell it. When you short sell, you "borrow" a certain number of stocks from someone who holds them. Let's say you borrow 100 shares of XYZ at $100 per share with a total value of $10,000. Once you borrow them, you sell them at $100 per share for $10,000. If a month later the price of XYZ goes down, let's say to $50 per share, all you need to do is buy 100 shares of XYZ at $50 per share for $5000 and give it back to the person you borrowed from (minus a small principle). You get to keep the difference between the price you sold it for ($10,000) and the price you bought it for ($5000), which is $5000.

However, if the price of the stock does not decrease, you are still required to return the same number of shares you borrowed. Let's say XYZ doesn't decrease in value but jumps from $100 per share to $150 per share. By the end of the month, you are required to buy 100 XYZ shares for $15,000 in order to return them (minus the principle you owe). You have now lost $5000 in your short sale because the stock increased in value.

&gt;What is a short squeeze?

A short squeeze is when the price of a stock is driven up (by purchasing the stock) in order to cause people who short sold the stock to lose money. The most popular short squeeze at this moment is GameStop or GME. A bunch of hedge fund managers short sold GME, which was trading at ~$20 per share at the beginning of the year, anticipating that it would drop in value. People at r/WallStreetBets saw this and decided to coordinate to buy GME and drive the price up. Currently, GME is trading for $350 per share. That means people who shorted GME at $20 per share, must now pay 17.5x what they borrowed in order to return the shares to whomever they borrowed them from.

&gt;What is stock manipulation?

By definition, "Market manipulation is the act of artificially inflating or deflating the price of a security or otherwise influencing the behavior of the market for personal gain." You could argue that what r/WSB has done is market manipulation, as they have driven up the price of a stock (GME) that has nothing to do with the value of the company or any natural market forces. Conversely, you could also argue that what Robin Hood did when they banned users from purchasing GME was market manipulation, as they took actions that affected the price of a stock regardless of what the market was indicating.

&gt;What is a hedge fund

A [hedge fund](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/102113/what-are-hedge-funds.asp) is "a limited partnership of investors that uses high risk methods, such as investing with borrowed money, in hopes of realizing large capital gains." It's basically a bunch of investors using money that is not theirs in order to make money in the stock market." It's basically a bunch of people getting together, pooling their money and telling a fund manager, "You can trade with this money we've pooled together to either go long if you think the market will rise or short if you think the market will go down."</text>

    <text>&gt; Are the Internet chortles worth it? Is it likely that only the short sellers will lose on this? This seems like a bad time to play with retirement money.

I mean, it all depends. Short sellers should lose, but depending on when you bought in you could lose too. If you buy at the top...yeah you're gonna lose. If you bought in at $20, you're safe.


But again, it all comes down to what you're comfortable risking. Never risk more than you can afford to lose. Same as walking in to a casino. Would losing $5k mean your kid doesn't go to college? Then yeah...keep that shit in a savings account or a safe ETF. Is $5k your monthly bonus and your house is paid off? Sure, go crazy. Only individual people can make that determination.</text>

    <text>Lurk on wallstreetbets for awhile. You can see people post their due diligence(research/opinions) on new opportunities, wins/loses, and the responses in the comments often have links to other sites with a ton of helpful info. And just look up terms or companies they mention outside of reddit. A lot of great info and a lot of bullshit which all helps to learn if you do a little research on your own.</text>

    <text>I don't know shit so I could be way off, but I think some people are gonna sell eventually. When they do, the price will drop, which is what the hedge funds want. The ones who got in early can make a good return if they sell. But some people I think are willing to lose money just to screw the hedge funds. More of a principle matter now? Stick it to the man type thing.  Again, I'm dumb about stocks, I only know what I've read the past few days.</text>

    <text>It's incredibly difficult to determine the success of a stock, up or down. But there is information that experts can use to side one way or the other. Most stock holders are just that, holders. 

Some folks bet that a stock will go down, not that it's necessarily worthless or a failing comoany. A bad earnings report will drop a stock price, bad press may drop a stock price, sometimes seemingly nothing will drop a stock price. But they short it based on information they beleive to be true, then borrow the stock (short), sell it at today's price, buy it at a lower price later, and give the stock back. Shorting is incredibly risky because the risk is technically infinite. 

For the holder, nothing happens. You got your stock back, and you made a little too. There was no risk for you. You continue to hold.

For the shorter, you either made money or lost money. But they use math, economics, news, in the know information, or just a desire to gamble to determine if a stock is worth shorting.</text>

    <text>Short sellers aren't always looking at bankruptcy. Take Boeing for example. Once news started coming out about their 737MAX planes mysteriously crashing, I'd wager a number of folk expected some sort of regulatory action and shorted the stock. Sure enough, the 737MAX line got grounded and the stock fell. But this doesn't mean Boeing will go out of business, or that their stock price will never rise to the same level or higher.

Short sellers are looking short term. Sometimes weeks, sometimes days, sometimes hours. They expect the price will fall at least temporarily, so they get in then get out after the drop.

The banks lending the shares are typically mutual funds who buy and hold stocks for years. They don't care about the day-to-day or month-to-month fluctuations of individual stocks. They care about the 5, 10, 20 year prospects of stocks. In those terms, Boeing is a pretty good bet. Overall, these really long holders earn some extra fees by lending out their stock to people that wanna daytrade while they soak up long term gains.</text>

    <text>And interest. The lender will charge interest (based on the current price, I believe) which means the borrower really doesn't want to just wait it out.

Not an expert here, but that's what I've heard and it makes why someone would loan the stock.</text>

    <text>How does anyone know what's happening with the short squeeze day-to-day?  Two questions: 1) Is there any publicly available information which tracks day-to-day short interest?  2) Would financial insiders have significantly better info on this than retail investors?  

Kind of a follow-up question - does anyone have any idea who is doing the buying and selling with all the volume that's taken place over the past two weeks?  

I ask because in the last two weeks volume is about 1.15 billion (or 1,150 million) shares.  Which is about 19X the number of shares which were reported as shorted.  What I'm saying is, how does anyone know that the shorts weren't part of the 1.15 billion shares changing hands and that they're not mostly out of the trade by now?  Does anyone have a clear picture (beyond just sentiment) as to what's driving the volume and price fluctuations?</text>

Have the guts to not sell unless it makes you money, and never panic sell, even if it takes you years. In which case, probably a good idea to not need the money you basically locked away for the sole purpose of investment. If it’s money you ever need to withdraw, you’re not going to invest well with that money because you WILL panic sell.

    <text>I suggest trading in the cryptocurrency sector. It's not controlled by Wallstreet, there are some good exchanges already, it's about building future technology and you can make way higher percentage gains than with stocks.

Also, some cryptocurrencies are currently trying to build decentralized exchanges. Meaning, you'll be able to do banking without the need for exchanges or banks or financial institutions. it'll give complete power to the people</text>

    <text>I’m dropping this simplified explanation everywhere since the same question comes up again and again, hope it helps!

Here’s a step by step:

i. Company issues shares because they want money. Investors buy the shares from the company.

ii. Investors start trading the shares with each other, and the price where they decide to trade becomes the price of the share.

iii. Brokers, such as RH or TD Ameritrade, let’s investors sign up, transfer money and/or shares onto their platform. This makes trading a lot easier (this is when the Investor signs the agreement that says ”yes, my shares are available to short”)

iv. One Investor, A, thinks the price of share X is to high. He wants to bet against, so he goes to the broker and says ”hey, let me borrow 100 share of X please”. The Broker responds with ”sure, that will cost 32% annually of the shares price in interest, compounded daily”. (a bit technical, but basically it costs a lot of money to short because the risk is high, and as the price goes up the cost can become astronomical since it’s based on a daily price rather than whatever you bought it for).

v. The Broker takes a share out of Investor B’s account, because B allowed shorting of his shares, and lend it out to A. In the agreement between the Broker and B it says that any dividends will be covered by the broker in the mean time, and in the agreement with A it says that any dividends will be covered by A. The broker is just a middleman between A and B, but as such takes on the risk that A can’t pay, hence they keep the majority of the interest.

vi. A now has one share borrowed, but since he doesn’t believe in it he turns around and sell it on the market to C for $10. A hopes that in time, he can buy it back for less than $10 + interest, and at that point he will return it to the broker who will in turn return it to B.
In this way, A gets the money from shorting up front, but doesn’t know how much he will have to buy it for in the future when he needs to return it.

vii. C also has an account with a broker, and along comes D who also wants to short the share. Through the broker he borrows the same share, turns around and sell it to E. The share has now been shorted twice. Only one real share exists, and it is in E’s account. But A owes one share to B, and D owes one share to C. Both B and C meanwhile, when they look at their account, will see a share of X sitting there, even though it actually isn’t. Share-credits has inflated the share supply, much as money-credit inflates the money supply.

Hope this was clear-ish!</text>

    <text>The options contracts have expiration dates typically. As the date draws closer to expiration that is where those margin calls come into play. My understanding is that these shorts involved naked calls (where it's not verified the stock exists and isn't bought/sold, it's just marked by the broker. It's illegal btw) leading to the 120% of short positions against the floating stock available. Pretty certain the short sellers cannot just ride the wave until their position becomes profitable.</text>

    <text>It’s worth less, but you didn’t borrow a dollar value from me, you borrowed a share of GME, which is what I want back.

I’m not lending out shares of GME that I’m holding in the hope of the price going up or down. I’m a broker that basically holds other investors’ accounts, some of whom happen to own GME. Part of the deal these investors have made with me is that I can lend out their shares (and i will probably pay them a small fee for this). So I lend you one of their shares and charge you interest. When you return the loan, I put it back in the warehouse of accounts I hold.</text>

    <text>If I thought a company's stock would go up, I would buy the stock. It would increase in value, and down the line, I could sell it to make a profit (I bought low, and sold high). If I have stock and think the company will do badly (the value of the stock will decrease), I should sell it ASAP. But what if I think the company will do badly, but I don't have any stock to sell?

Let's say you have GME stocks. I think GME stock is going to crash, but you disagree. So we make a deal, whereby I borrow your GME stock, and promise to give it back to you a month later. 

Immediately after borrowing the stock, I sell it - let's say, for $5 a stock. A month later, the stock has decreased to $1. I then buy the stock I owe you from someone else, and return it to you. I just made $4 per stock. 

Roughly, this is what was supposed to happen with GME. But what happened instead is, a bunch of people realized that if they forced the stock to go up instead, then a bunch of really, really rich investors would have no chance but to buy it at the inflated price (_any_ price) when the time came to settle the deal. So the people buying the stock are the investors who tried to 'short' it - they have no choice, because they owe someone. They don't owe money, they owe stocks. They have to pay someone back, in the form of stocks. So they have to get those stocks somehow, regardless of their price.</text>

    <text>So if I am a short seller coming to you to borrow 10000's of shares to drive the price down, do you factor that into your rent calculation? Do you not expect that I might be successful in dropping the price by 50%? Is this event rare enough that in general the math works out that the interest charged in these loans normal works out well?</text>

    <text>We are fucking over the hedge funds, this is basically billionaires and millionaires who put money into fund or a group of professional investors that uses that money to try to earn even more money. If a hedge fund is doing well, then their rich clients and themselves will get money.

The hedge funds wanted to 'short sell' GME stocks. Short selling is a strategy to earn money by borrowing a stock from the market people then instantly selling that stock however they still need to buy back that stock that they are borrowing and it comes with a fee upfront and has a deadline.

In example, a hedge fund borrows 1 GME stock for $50 then sells it for $50. They still owe 1 GME stock. If GME stocks goes down to $20, then the hedge fund will buy back the stock for $20 with their $50 they sold and give back the stock to the market people after paying a small fee. They earn $30.

However reddit decided to buy a shit ton of GME stocks after it was reportedly leaked that major hedge funds were gonna to short sell GME. Buying a shit ton of a particular stock inflates that stocks value and price.

In example, a hedge fund borrows 1 GME stock for $50 then sells it for $50. They still owe 1 GME stock. If GME stocks goes up to $200, then the hedge fund will have to buy back the stock at $200 before the deadline. They need an additional $150 to buy and return that stock thus losing money. Imagine this is the billions of dollars.</text>

    <text>another thing i haven't seen discussed is what i've seen being called a "short ladder" AKA the same hedge funds shorting the same stock again in an attempt to both drive the price of their original shorted stock down, and to anticipate the stock price fall after the short squeeze and profit off of that as well. i've seen speculation some funds may have been doing this in order to scare retail investors into selling their stock by trying to make it appear like the "peak" has already passed</text>

They stand to gain if they do, but stand to lose unending amounts if the opposite happens.  
Buying stocks causes this to happen because the price of GameStop goes up instead of down.</text>

    <text>It's true that it will go down again. This is what most people would call as catching a falling knife. Since the stock is moving up and down in an unpredictable manner, if u don't time your entry to short correctly, you might hit a great loss before making a profit.</text>

    <text>They’re fucking over rich hedge fund billionaires. Those hedge fund billionaires like to short stocks (Bet money that the stock will continue to decrease) Well because WallStreetBets keep buying GameStop stocks and holding them, the stock price rises which means the hedge fund billionaires lose their bet that GameStop stock would fall. So in the end, WSB makes money and hedge fund fuckers get fucked. It’s a beautiful sight.</text>

    <text>It will go down eventually.  The problem is that the current short needs to be covered before that happens since there are literally more shares owed than exist.

A good example to think of is a life saving drug.  Someone who needs that to live *must* buy it or die, so barring regulation, the people who make the drug can name their price.  Same situation with GME.  The hedge funds *must* cover the short or die.</text>

    <text>It's kind of complicated, because it's based around the idea of short selling.

Several hedge funds basically placed huge bets that the value of Game Stop stock would go down. If the stock goes down, they make money, if the stock goes up, they lose money. The more the stock goes up, the more money they lose.

Everyone on wall street bets is buying stock to drive the price of Game Stop up, and if they keep it up, it will cost these hedge funds billions of dollars. 

Part of this, is that these hedge funds will be forced to buy stock at this new higher price, which will further drive the price up, which will cost them more to buy. Right now, there is not enough available stock for the hedge funds to buy (supply is low), which will drive the price even higher. This is what's called a "short squeeze"

It's basically a perfect storm, and rich people are on the wrong side of it for once.</text>

    <text>Its the same as owning a house. You have an asset and that is worth something. You could decide to sell it if you want to make money from it, or let people borrow it to trade and they have to pay you to do that. 

I know that the companies that lend their shares out are just as money hungry as the people using these shares to short companies. There will be a fairly hefty margin on top of the actual share price that the borrower needs to take into account when performing these types of transactions.</text>

    <text>I think I can explain this one. Basically, Wall Street have shorted billions on GME. A short is when they borrow a number of shares, which they sell off for current market value, let's day $20. Then, after a given time frame, they buy back the same amount of shares, and give them back. If the share value has halved to $10 for example, then the person who shorted keeps the extra $10 from each share.

Wall Street were apparently very recklessly shorting GME, which could create a self fulfilling prophesy, as they say it will go bankrupt, so people lose faith in GME and it drops.

However, Wall Street bets (the subreddit) have created massive hype behind the share, taking it from under $20 up to several hundred. The people who shorted will have to buy them back once their short is up (read that was Friday or Sunday, but I'm not 100% on that). So, if they paid 15$ per share, they're now going to have to buy them back at several hundred dollars, so they are gonna lose a lot.</text>

    <text>Good question. Typical settlement of a trade occurs “T+2” 

This means that if you borrowed stock to sell short today (t+0) you would need to return it in two business days (T+2)

    <text>Robinhood is a app you can get to trade stocks. You use your money to buy a stock at a certain price that is based on the current market value. If you sell the stock you get the money of the current market value so you can make profit or loose money. When you buys a share/stock, or in the current situation where sever thousands of people buy a lot of stocks/shares, you influence the price and the stock/share goes up as the request for it is high. Robinhood removed the option to buy stocks/shares of certain companies like GameStop (GME), BlackBerry (BB) or Nokia (NOK). With this happening they influenced the stockmarket, as you can’t buy and only sell the stock/share. This had the result of the GameStop stock Fall quite a bit. The problem now is that market manipulation is illegal and that’s basically what Robinhood did. The reasons for their despising to remove the option to buy certain stocks is a different story!

    <text>As others have said, the Big Short does a pretty solid job. But basically what happened was people took a mortgage on their house when they could barely afford to make their payments. Then since they took out an adjustable rate mortgage, when that payment increased, they couldn't afford it. Simultaneously this caused a lot of people to sell their house which caused housing prices to drop. So now some people had a mortgage for $500,000 on a house they could sell for $350,000. 

The banks had the assumption that housing prices only go up. So the was a lot of money to be had in originating mortgages. So they created products that would speed the process up. Instead of getting a credit score run and having an underwriter validate all your information, they had "Started Income Started Assets" mortgages where the borrower would just sign on the line and said this was accurate. What happened was a lot of people were overstating their income. Now some did it intentionally, some were duped. Eventually those people couldn't afford their house anymore.

There was also the creation of the adjustable rate mortgage (ARM). A typical mortgage says you pay x% interest on your loan for 30 years. Well the bank has to look at not just what interest rates are now, but predict where they'll be in 30 years to make sure they lend at a rate that's profitable for them too. The ARM however, has a shorter fixed period. This period was usually 1, 3, 5, 7, or 10 years. After that, the rate would adjust based on the terms of the contract and the market movement. This is beneficial to the lender because they don't have to worry so much about the uncertain future of rates, so it benefits the borrower by getting a lower rate (and thus lower payment) at the beginning. However as rates typically move up, your adjusted rate usually goes up. So if you can barely afford the house now, you have a few years before you have pay more for it. Some people didn't realize this was going to happen so they couldn't afford to keep paying.

Now while all these mortgages are going belly up, the mortgage backed securities (MBS) that traded are losing money. So the end investors of these (guys like AIG) don't have the value they were expecting and were at risk of not being able to meet their duties to pay out their insurance policies. Just one example of the ripple effect.</text>

    <text>A stock is a tiny slice of ownership of a company.  You are entitled to a share of the earnings and assets and liabilities of that company, subject to certain rules.

An option is the right to buy or sell something (say, a barrel of oil, or a stock) in the future, at a pre-fixed price.

Typically, companies by options as a form of insurance.  So let's say you harvest bat shit in Peru and sell it in the US, you’re very exposed to changes in the peso/USD exchange rate, because your expenses and revenues are in different currencies. But you don’t want to take currency risk—you want to harvest bat shit. So you buy options to cover your ass in case dollars decline or pesos spike.</text>

    <text>Buying a stock is basically buying a small piece of ownership in the company. If a company has 100 shares, each share represents an ownership interest.

Buying an option is basically buying a contract that gives you certain rights in terms of buying or selling a share from someone else. Not to get too into it, but there are two types of options.

Call options give you right to buy a share at a predetermined price at a predetermined point in the future (simplifying a few things). The predetermined price is called the strike. So if I buy a call option on GameStop with a strike of $10, I have the right to acquire a stock of GameStop from the person who sold me the call at $10. If the market price of GameStop is $20, I can make a quick $10 by exercising my option, paying $10, getting the share, and immediately selling it for $20.

Put options are the reverse. They give me the right to sell a share at a predetermined price. So if buy a put option with a strike price of $15, I can force the person who I bought the put option from to buy a share at $15. If the market price is $5, I will buy the share on the market, exercise the put and sell my share for $15.</text>

    <text>I see.  Who keeps selling these call options?  On RH you couldn't buy call options above a certain point, but every day at close GME had reached the highest call option available.  

Are the higher strike price call options always there?  Or are people actually still selling calls at higher and higher prices?</text>

    <text>How can a stock be shorted more than 100% of the stocks available?  From what I understand you can only short shares that your broker has available.  Are these hedge funds just pulling GME stock out of their ass to sell when they don't really have any?</text>

    <text>Let's say it's january and you know that a loot of people would like to eat strawberries right now. You know a guy who is a bit weird, but good natured. He has a green house where he grows them and he has a small supply.
Now you want to make a buck off of selling strawberries while they are in high demand. So you ask the guy if you can have a pound of strawberries to sell. You promise to give him a pound back later in the year, because you know that in May or June, you will be able to buy strawberries everywhere. You also promise to reimburse him for the inconvenience with a little interest. 

Your strawberries guy says ok, and you take the pound and go and sell it for twenty dollars. Right now, you have gained 20.
In May, you go to wholefoods and buy a pound of strawberries for 4 Dollars and give it back to the guy. You also give him a Dollar as reimbursement. You have now lost five dollars, but your net win from this is 15 (20-5). So basically, you made a bet in January thar strawberries will get cheaper through the year, and you were right.

That's how you make money betting on losses</text>

    <text>Their friends who desperately needed to buy stock they already sold.  Also with a lot less people buying and only their friends selling they could make the price much lower very fast with a manipulated price.  Some people had automatic sell orders in place so they would be able to sell in case the price suddenly dropped to protect their loses.  Instead they stole those for well less than market value.

People see the stock price drop suddendly and because no one can buy there is no upward pressure to raise the price.  So it looks like everyone is selling but really what happens is the low volumes inflate the price drop.  This causes them to panic so they sell.

So they manipulated the market 3 different ways to help themselves.

What they didn't account for was the very large number of people who refused to selll so they could not tank it further.

Tomorrow they are in a slightly better position but still screwed unless they pull some other very shaddy things.

Life lesson: little guys lose everything in the stock market a okay.  Big guys lose?  Rig the system.

Little guy steals 10k.  Prison for may years.
Big guy steals billions, small fine.

The stole billions today from regular people when they were about to lose.  Likely they calculate the fine and knew it would cost less.</text>

    <text>But if 1 person offered to buy 1 GME share for a million dollars (let's say as an expensive joke), would this then make the price for GME $1m? I am assuming it would only be until the next GME share is sold at whatever the actual market price is?

And does this mean the WSB are driving up the price simply by saturating the market with blatant overbids for the stocks, analogous to you selling iphones for $500, and a horde of redditors coming in and saying "No no, we want to buy them for $1m each!"</text>

    <text>I'm confused about this. If you borrow shares and immediately sell them...aren't those shares not your hands anymore? Why do you then need to buy something back that is in the hands of another investor? Isn't the person that I now sold those shares to responsible for buying them back from the original lender?</text>

    <text>I borrow one share from you and immediately sell it for $100 with the promise that I'll give you a share back a week later.  I put $100 in my pocket.

Over the course of the week, the per-share value crashes to $10/share.

A week later, I purchase one share for $10, and give it back to you as promised.

Of the $100 I originally made, I had to spend $10 to buy the share back (to be returned to you), and get to pocket the $90 difference.</text>

    <text>Those that shorted the stock that needed to buy back in to cover their short positions. Certain retail investors had pre-selected "sell if it hits this price" orders that they didn't think would hit.. pretty much a last resort savior position. Since RobinHood restricted their customers on certain "volatile" stocks to only selling, it resulted in a dramatic price drop. It artificially snowballed because Robjnhood conspired with the hedge funds (losing their ass) to prevent retail investors from buying and supporting GameStop.</text>

    <text>Shorting is borrowing shares, immediately selling them, then buying them back when the share price is even lower in the future. Since you buy them back for less money than you made selling them, you profit. One reason a share owner might enlist a hedge fund to short for them is that a hedge fund can do it on a much larger scale, and a ton of shares all being dumped in a stock can trigger others to panic sell too, which drives down the share price further and creates a sort of self fulfilling prophecy for the hedge fund, allowing them to buy them back again cheaper.

The reason these hedge funds are getting reamed is because due to shorting them, they *have* to buy the shares back as they're only borrowed and they're contractually obliged to return them. 

Massively shorted stocks are also sometimes weak enough and vulnerable to having their share price inflated by a (relatively) small group of coordinated buyers, as has happened with Gamestop.</text>

    <text>Because pension funds invest in hedge funds. It is a diversifying asset class that is expected to return between what bonds return and equities return. The ones in the news (Melvin, Citron,Citadel,etc) have been darlings of the industry for a long time. They just didn’t account for this type of scenario. Same thing for the guys from the big short. At the end of the day, as a pension, you invest in long-short equity funds In the belief that removing a mangers long-only (as in you can only buy stocks) limits their ability to express their views fully. By allowing them to short, you let them express both their positive (buy) and negative (short) views on stocks. Additionally, most hedge fund managers in the long/short space try to keep a very low exposure to the market (beta), so what you get is just pure, uncorrelated excess returns. It’s also important to point out that there are hedge funds doing currency, macro, credit, etc, so it’s not just stocks.</text>

    <text>Institutional investors like the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS) invest a portion of their $$ in hedge funds.  The hedge funds take that $$ and make trades.  The hedge funds decided to short GameStop, not the pension funds themselves.

Short version: the hedge funds are losing tons of $$ on the GameStop shorts, which means that the value of the pension funds’ investments in the hedge funds is decreasing.  If it decreases enough, and the pension funds aren’t making enough $$ on other investments, then the pension funds can reduce payments to retirees and / or increase the retirement age from 65 to 70, etc.  These people depend on their pension fund managers to make investments decisions that ensure that these people get the benefits they’ve earned over their years of service.

It’s not wrong for pension funds to invest in hedge funds.  Most do.  But they should also invest in many other strategies to diversify and mitigate risk.  Hopefully we don’t get another Detroit or Stockton situation.</text>

    <text>I will take a crack at it. Imagine that a stock is worth $10 today, but you’re pretty sure it will be worth only $5 in a week from now. So, what you do is you borrow a stock from someone with the promise you will give it back in a week. In the meantime you sell that stock for $10, and in a week you will have to buy a new one to give back from the person you originally, hopefully for only $5. If you can do this, you just made $5, and all you had to do no real work to make that money. This is called shorting.

What happened with GameStop is a big hedge fund “borrowed” tons of shares, even more than 100% of those currently available, and were expecting the price to have significantly fallen by the time they had to return them. However, people used the publicly available knowledge that the hedge fund had a massive, shady, outstanding debt to say “hey, they **have** to buy shares at the end of the month, so if we buy the current supply the price will rise, and they will actually *lose* a boatload.” This is called a short squeeze.</text>

    <text>They exist, they are excluding hard to trade shares from the denominator because the calculation looks at how easy it is for shorts to close their positions.  The denominator of the 140% calculation doesn't include shares held by company executives and founders and some types of funds (that are expected not to trade very often). 

So if the public owns 10,000,000 shares of a company with 5,000,000 borrowed, and the founder owns another 20,000,000 shares, and someone borrows 5,000,000 of his shares, the short to float is (5,000,000 plus 5,000,000) over 10,000,000 or 100% not 30,000,000 (because 20 million of the shares don't really trade).</text>

    <text>Alice has 100 shares. Bob thinks the stock will go down, so he borrows (for a fee) those 100 shares and promises to give them back at a set time. So he sells them, and will buy them back when it's time to give them back to Alice. Charlie buys the shares from Bob, so he now has those 100 shares. Doug also thinks the stock will go down, so he borrows the shares from Charlie and sells them. We now have 200 shares worth of short positions based on 100 shares of stock.</text>

    <text>Okay, so when a company goes public they receive funds from the sales and use it to get the business rolling correct? But what happens after that? How does the company benefit from its stock increasing in value? Like with GameStop, there’s people making and losing money on the stock but what does it mean for GameStop? Do they benefit from all this activity?</text>

    <text>You're mostly right - it's valued at whatever the market values it at. This could be expected profit, I suppose, but it also has to do with things like cash on hands and other assets, debts, and market sentiment for the future.

For example, Tesla is valued at more than the next 10 biggest (biggest as in market cap or "company value") car manufacturers combined, despite the fact that it holds 0.5% of the global market share for automobiles and only barely scrapes by with profits (it lost money for essentially 18 years straight). It is valued insanely high for no *fundamental* reason - you can't point at their financial documents and make a solid argument for why they are valued how they are. You can, however, point to the products they are developing and where they might be in 20 years and try to use that to argue their current value. But then someone can counter argue "Well, if they are valued at what they should be worth 20 years from now, what is the upside over the next 20 years?"

You're also close on dividends but not quite. Dividends pay out a small portion of the companies profits every year - think of it as a profit sharing program. Not all stocks have dividends, many do not. To my previous point, Tesla does not and has not ever offered a dividend, and Elon Musk has said that they do not plan on offering one in the foreseeable future either.</text>

    <text>Not all of them become due at the same time and the same unit of stock can be short sold due in 3 months, and in 6 months, without immediately causing an issue. Even if the shorts are recalled early, the same stock can be used to cover a short, delivered to the lender, then sold be that same lender which allows another short seller to cover his position. This process is not frictionless so it still pumps the stocks up, but the 100% limit is not automatically a catastrophe.</text>

After the price drops you buy back the stocks and give them back to whoever you borrowed from.

    <text>Jim deposits $1000 in a bank, the bank then loans out $200 of that to Joe. This is acceptable, and as long as you don't lend out too much of Jim's money, it shouldn't be an issue. 

The problem with the GME short is that the amount shorted is more than actually out in the market. 

Lending shares isn't necessarily a bad thing, it helps keep the market moving. If every share of a company was held and no one sold ever, how do we know what it is worth? Allowing these synthetic shares to float around keeps the market moving even if most people are not trading them.</text>

    <text>Nicely said!  A very wise investor once said “Losses (and gains) aren’t real until you realize them.”  Or stated more plainly like you just did...losses and gains only occur when you sell or close your positions.  Otherwise it’s all mostly noise and funny money.

Look at the stock market over the last year...not all of us have the benefit of being Congressmen with insider trading, so all of our investments “lost” a lot of money last spring.  Until the market eventually recovered and those “losses” suddenly became big gains.  All of it illusions, because if you just put all your money into a target retirement fund like I did, I won’t “gain” or “lose” anything until I hit 65.</text>

    <text>In practice I think it can get more complex, but here's a simple hypothetical scenario:

A owns 5 stocks of company X. B borrows 5 stocks from A and says they will return them in at most a month.

Now B owns 5 stocks of X, but must return them to A at some point. Just after that, B sells these 5 stocks. A happens to want to buy them, so B sells to A.

So now we are in a situation where A again has 5 stocks but B still is owes A 5 stocks. (The only difference is that money was exchanged.)

The whole process can be repeated (B again borrows 5 stocks from A), so that now B owes 10 stock to A.

This all could have happened if that 5 was all the stocks of X in existence on the market. So now, B owes A 200% of existing stocks of X. They will have to give back that 5 stocks they have (unless they sold it, then they have to re-buy it) and re-buy it again after giving back the part.

Of course in practice it is probably not as likely that the same person that lent stocks to B will buy from them and in practice there are many more players on the market.</text>

    <text>The giant billion dollar hedgefund weren't betting on a stock to go down they were trying to force it down by shorting over 100% of a stock in this case GameStop. By shorting that massive amount they are trying to trick others into thinking the stock is worth even less than it currently is thus luring people how actually have the stock in their hold to sell en mass and when that happens the stock price drops and then they can cover their short/bet.

Basically a reverse pump and dump where people hype a new stock up making it go from pennies to 10s of dollars then sell their stake while its high.</text>

    <text>Appreciate the question. Brokers can halt one side of the trade. And it's actually most often the buy side.

Simple example: Let's say you bought pharmaceutical company XYZ because they released a statement that the FDA will approve their new COVID vaccine. But then news breaks that XYZ made that statement up. Now they are under investigation by the SEC for market manipulation. A brokerage firm in the act of playing parent will stop buy orders for XYZ because they don't want their customers buying stock in a company that is currently being investigated. But, what about you? They'll allow you to sell that stock you own so you won't get stuck with potentially worthless stock.</text>

    <text>This is a bit of a misnomer. If there is a share of stock, and I short it, I borrow it from person A, and then sell it to person B. Person B then turns around and shorts it with their broker, and let’s person C borrow it to sell, now you have over 100% short interest. The same share is shorted twice. There’s no way of knowing that a specific share is being borrowed by another broker.</text>

    <text>You're correct that worst case is you drop to zero, but think of the broker as your over protective parent.  If they deem the stock too risky they'll stay away from it. And they want you to stay away from it because if you lose all your money from bad investments, they just lost a customer. Not because you left the broker, but because now you can't invest at all and there's no more money to be made from you.</text>

    <text>Since shorting a stock requires selling those borrowed share(s), if you sell them to an entity that chooses to let you borrow that same stock you sold them, you can short the same share(s) twice. That is the basics of how GME was shorted 140%.</text>

    <text>Basically, I have a ton of bananas. Most of them. Are old and brown and rotten, but some are nice. So I put them all in boxes and put the nice ones on top, so it looks like a regular box of nice bananas. I then sell those boxes to people who believe that the bananas will increase in value. These people, however, never actually took a deep look into the box and just assumed that it was all nice bananas. Now, a good time later, someone decides to actually look into the boxes. Noticing they're almost all worthless, this triggers a moment where everyone is trying to panic-sell the bananas, but since now everyone knows they're rotten and shit, there's no demand. So there's huge amounts of bananas that no one wants, making the banana price fall to shit.</text>

    <text>Actually, follow-up question, if you don't mind.

How does that work for people who've already bought?

I mean, let's say that I buy into a tiny little startup, and they're only selling 10 stocks. I buy one, so.. I now own a tenth of their stocks

Then they get bigger and more successful, and suddenly instead of 10 stocks they're offering 100. But my position hasn't changed. I bought a tenth of something, but now I only own a hundredth of it. That seems like.. not a great deal.

I'm assuming there are factors I'm not accounting for here, but.. I don't know what they are.</text>

    <text>One share can be shorted many times. Say I borrow from you and sell to John. John then lends the share to me again and I sell it to Jack.

Essentially, I owe 1 share to you and 1 share to John. But there is only one share in existence, and that's in Jack's hands.

It is not illegal, but a stupid move to make. Because if Jack refuses to sell me the share, I cant pay it back to John, and if he refuses to sell again, I cant pay it back to you. This demand makes the price rise to infinity.</text>

    <text>&gt;The actual owner is relatively unaffected.

The value of their share went down, (in part because of the short selling, if I am understanding.) Doing business with short sellers makes the stock value go down, are the stock owners getting enough in fees to make up the difference. It seems like a losing deal to me.</text>

    <text>It's not bad from GME's point of view. They've been strangely silent about it even. It's very bad from the point of view of hedge funds who took risky positions with theoretically unlimited losses.

Just to throw it out there a stock price has literally zero direct influence on a companies finances. A very high stock price can result in:

1) Employees with an extra spring in their step

2) Lower interest rates for capital loans 

3) More access to needed capital in general (it's easier to fundraise)

4) Access to more/easier money if they choose to sell more stock. 

Unless GME sells some of its stock or issues new stock, the price could be a billion per share. It doesn't influence their finances.</text>

    <text>Additionally Robinhood (the retail trading platform loads of wsb uses, and which restricted $GME to closing or selling) is owned by the capital firm Citadel. Citadel also owns Melvin Capital, the hedge fund that was the main short seller involved in this.

Citadel have come forward to say that they didn't have anything to do with this decision, but I don't necessarily believe them.</text>

    <text>What got them in trouble was that they were acting illegally in the first place.  WSB just picked up on it and exploited it.

ELI5: it is illegal to short shares you don’t know exist.  The short sellers shorted 140% of the available stock, so somebody was shorting shares that didn’t exist.  Now they are all scrambling to buy as many shares as they can to pay back what they borrowed, knowing that the supply will run out and when it does the shares become priceless.  You want my shares?  Give me your yacht.</text>

    <text>Let's say there are 100 shares total.

Person A buys 100 shares.

Person B wants to short 100 shares and borrows them from Person A to sell. He is able to, and sells to person C.

Person D wants to short 100 shares and borrows them from Person C to sell. He is able to and sells to someone else.

Now there are 100 shares total, but 200 shares sold short. That's how it can happen legally (no naked shorts required). And in my example, Person C and Person D need not exist, it could have gone back to person A and person B, technically.</text>

    <text>As you'll read on the other answers here, there is really a large momentum for prices to rise since there is no way to cover their positions without at least buying stocks twice for the hedge fund; this is the squeeze. Couple this with the fact that while they wait, they must pay a loaning fee. This is *based on some percentage of the current market price,* and pair this with the colossal amounts of stock they borrowed, we can see how they are screwed either way this goes.</text>

    <text>&gt;Were the hedge funds being immoral in their previous practices

That's a big yes. Their role in the '08 crash is well known and they are infamous for fucking up the world's economy for their bottom line. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Was what WSB bets immoral?

Not really, if you steal from a thief are you really stealing? And they didn't really steal anything either. They just bet that Gamestop would increase in price. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Was anything either side was doing illegal?

This is much tougher to answer, we are in unprecedented legal territory. I cannot stress this enough, this has NEVER happened before. Like ever, in the history of the world. We are witnessing history happen right now. But I doubt that anyone from WSB would be prosecuted, they are a collective without a leader. And I doubt any billionaire will be prosecuted because they, are well, billionaires.</text>

    <text>" They borrowed and sold a record amount - they sold more shares, in fact, than are actually traded, far more than Gamestop's float. This shouldn't have been allowed to happen and probably means they were selling shares they never even bothered to borrow - naked shorts. (Where were you on that one, SEC?) Essentially, they were simultaneously betting on Gamestop going bankrupt and doing their best to drive them into bankruptcy. It's a good tactic when you need to find a way to pay for your old wife's alimony and your new wife's poolboy. "

    <text>The reality is that this has absolutely nothing to do with GME.   
None of that money goes to GME, its going from trader to trader. GME the company inst selling stock, this is all stock that has been previously issued, and is going back and forth between people/trading funds. 

The company could technically issue more stock but it takes a while and will likely miss this surge.   


GME originally issued this stock at its IPO in 2002 and as a company doesn't make more money from it.   


The only reason were talking about GME as a company is because some funds hated the stock so the over shorted it. That put them in a position that could and has bankrupted those companies and they think we did bad because we caught them.</text>

    <text>The hedge funds (mainly Melvin Capital) were short selling GameStop stocks. That means they were borrowing shares (for a fee) and selling them right away in the hopes that they could buy back those shares later at a lower price to give back to the lender.  
You do this if you anticipate falling prices and it pushes the price of the stock down as more stock is temporarily available (supply and demand regulate price). The risk in doing this is that the price can go up and you still need to buy back those shares to give back to the lender. As there is no limit to how high the price can go, your losses can theoretically be infinitely high, which is why short selling is very risky. 

What arguably was immoral and possibly illegal is how heavily the stock was shorted. 140% of the available stock was shorted (so borrowed, sold, and borrowed again). Arguably this was a naked short which is illegal. You need to reasonable expect to be able to give back the shares. It also artificially pushed down GameStop prices in an attempt to bankrupt them.

WSB recognised that the stock was shorted way too much and bought up shares in an effort to drive up prices, forcing the short sellers to buy back stocks at a higher price, which further drives prices up.  
This is called a “short squeeze”. 

WSB did not act illegally and used publicly available information for this strategy. 

Citadel also gave $2,75 Billion to Melvin Capital to withstand the short squeeze but it was looking good for WSB until Robin Hood didn’t allow their users to buy GME shares (and a few other hyped shares). This tanked the price of GME, as people from WSB weren’t able to buy anymore.  
There is reason to believe that Robin Hood did this to protect Citadel as most of Robin Hood’s trades go through Citadel. Of course they deny this and argue they had to stop the trade due to market regulations.

Whether that’s true, we will see.

A class action lawsuit has been filed and the Attorney General of the USA is investigating the entire situation to see if any illegal activity took place on either side. To me it looks like Robin Hood may have in fact acted illegally, but we will see.</text>

    <text>Everybody sends in bids and asks to an exchange, saying I will pay X dollars per share for Y shares of stock Z, or I will sell X shares of stock Y for Z dollars per share.

The exchange matches up buyers and sellers according to some algorithm, and makes those... exchanges.

Eventually once all the possible trades are made, you're left with a bunch of bids asking to buy a stock for less than the lowest price a seller is willing to sell it for, and a bunch of asks wanting to sell the stock for more than the highest bidder is willing to pay for it.  So the price lines between that highest bidder and the lowest asker.  

The singular price reported is the price of the last exchange made, but you'll find bid and ask values.  For high volume stuff, the bid and ask usually riiight next to each other, with the stock price somewhere in between them.</text>

    <text>Yes, this stop of trading restricted to only selling spread across many exchanges. What happened today is the definition of market manipulation as they only allowed users to sell during the height of the GME push while allowing the hedge funds to continue to trade and drop the price by 50%. 

Robinhood is the easiest case to prove because there are direct ties between Marvin Capital (fund who shorted over 100% of stock) and their parent company Citadel who's happens to own about 40% of Robinhoods stock. Its going to be interesting to see how this plays out and what the SEC/government does.

Bout time these giants got wrecked for their greed. Enjoying see them go to this level and face the consciences of their actions, at their expense for once. Well see if it actually happens the way it should in a "free market". Lol</text>

    <text>Basically, none of the shares being sold/bought today affect Gamestop (GME) today. When a company goes public (IPO), they sell a set amount of stock at a specific price. The people who buy these shares are usually big companies/very wealthy people, who then can either keep the stock or sell it to someone else, and that's how the stock gets to wall street. The initial sale is the only time GME directly benefits from the sale of the stock. 

Gamestop could sell more shares at the current price, but i'm not sure how that would work, or if they even can on such short notice. If they are able to do so, and choose to do so, They could potentially raise a significant sum of money instantly. Doing this would likely anger a huge number of the WSB "investors" who are currently propping up the company, because they would essentially be giving the hedge funds an easy way to buy shares to exit their disastrous shorts that are causing this whole thing. 

I am very much not an expert, so hopefully someone more knowledgeable will chime in and correct any mistakes I've made or possibly add more useful information. 

Disclaimer: I currently own 5 shares of GME. None of this is financial advice in any way.</text>

    <text>Actually, I don't agree with that reading. I think most of the people hyped about the stock absolutely do want to make a bunch of money (which is fine). Also I've seen a lot of posts about people YOLOing tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars. Anyway, they've invested in it and the surest way for them to make it through the squeeze is to convince other people to buy and ride it with them, so they focus on these buy and hold posts. The phenomenon shares a lot in common with the psychology of MLMs, in my opinion. I genuinely hope everyone makes their money and gets out before the stock tanks, but I think there's a lot of risk here and no one really wants to talk about it.</text>

Yes, that's how I also see it. It is possibly legal (as opposed to the often mention "naked shorting") if there was no collusion between the multiple funds that shorted, since they didn't know that the lenders were already shorting it from an earlier source. Still, even at this most charitable interpretation, shorting without checking the available float is still a reckless and frankly a boneheaded thing to do. After all, it's a basic knowledge how limitless losses could be when shorting.</text>

    <text>It's only "artificial" in that it isn't representing the value of the company right now. 

What it's representing right now is that hedge funds with near unlimited resources have said "No matter the price, we will be buying 140% of the shares on the market starting on January 29^(th)." 

Like if a billionaire moved in next door to you and said "tomorrow I will buy every apple in this town, no matter the cost." You're going to drive to the grocery store, clean them out, and open a stand selling $1,000 apples.</text>

    <text>It was called a "credit crunch". That means the privately owned bank called "the federal reserve" wouldn't take the government's credit to print US dollars. They do this every decade or so, so theres less money in the economy and people start defaulting on their loans and start losing the wealth they put up for collateral. 

The system is set up as a funnel pointed upwards so that wealth moves from the 99% to the 1%.

The reason 2008 was so significant was they printed alot more money in the years leading up to it so everyone was taking loans out, then when they stopped taking the government's credit, the bubble popped. At the time it was the largest shift in wealth from the 99% to the 1% but it was nothing compared to 2020.

Heres a link in more detail about the process of money being printed. The site also has links to a documentary about the corruption in wall st. In 2008</text>

    <text>US government tried to get every American to buy a home by offering government backed loans.

Poor people lied on their applications with the lenders help. Middle class people began buying homes to rent or sell to others. Real estate prices were rising faster than inflation. Banks were grouping these debts together and sold them as assets that people could buy and sell.

Eventually people ran out of ways to pay their debts.</text>

    <text>I don’t think you are missing much. If GameStop plays their cards right then this could be a good money making opportunity for them which could allow them to pay off some of their debt that they have accumulated. Even with the money, I think the hard part for them will still be rebuilding their business. Being a mall (which are dying) based video game retail store (which are dying) is kind of a bad double whammy for them. Even with the injection of cash that they are hopefully getting from this, they still have a long ways to go.</text>

    <text>Is short selling immoral: as everything to do with morality its personal. In my opinion its needed for a functioning market. Companies like gamestop are not likely to survive and companies should be able to hedge theirselves against their demise. Problem is that it was such a logical company to bet against that a lot of funds did. Wsb found out that they could fuck some of these funds over by buying all the shares. Not only wsb did this but other hedge funds aswell because when traders find someones weakness they capitalize.</text>

    <text>Yeah it takes 2 business days for a transaction to settle, and every brokerage must post collateral during those 2 days in case there's some sort of transaction issue or either party fails to deliver (this is generally known as T+2.) The amount of collateral you need to post depends on the volatility of what's being transacted - and since it increased at such an unprecedented rate, many brokerages didn't have the funds and had / have to temporarily block new opening orders.</text>

Due to some reason, the pie economy in the class goes haywire and the kids are trading all their money for a single crumb of pie. 

Now, as the baker of said pie, you feel great. A crumb of your pie is worth a lot of money. But unfortunately for you, you already distributed all the slices of pie and the value of a crumb means  nothing to you because you have no crumbs.</text>

    <text>As a mentor of mine from the finance industry used to say, what we are seeing here with the short squeeze is “too many fat arses looking for the same thin exit.”

During the GFC, large fund managers learnt a very painful lesson about liquidity (being the amount of shares traded on a daily basis). If you own a lot of stock with low liquidity, you can’t exit your position very quickly, causing your eventual losses to be much larger by the time you sell. Many fund manager went under because of this, and most funds have strict minimal liquidity requirements before they will buy into a stock.

The failure here is by a number of hedge funds seemingly not learning this lesson, and quite frankly they deserve to go to the wall because of it. Greed + stupidity is a dangerous combination.</text>

    <text>It's more about exposing market manipulation and other possibly illegal trading activities at this point.  This story has gotten so wild that it has been thrust into the national and international spotlight, and it is starting a discussion regarding trading regulations that have been exploited by hedge funds for years.  It's a little more nuanced and impactful than "owning the rich."  A lot of people potentially lost a lot of money today because some brokerages decided to impede on a "free market" by restricting buying of several stocks.  But I guess we could just throw our hands up and keep being bent over like we have for decades.</text>

    <text>You are mostly right, but it actually can if the company is a financial company in great distress. Financial companies are required by regulators to maintain a minimum amount of equity in their capital structure. If the company is under great distress, short sellers can force a liquidation and destroy the company. This occurred a few times in '08, people called it the "death spiral."</text>

    <text>You're making a very good point here.
Let's say for example they shorted around 600k GME stocks at around 25$ per stock (a very conservative estimate). If the stock was manipulated as intended and GME reached, say, $3, Hedgers would net a profit of around the ballpark of $12,500,000 after fees and whatnot. That's their benefit of shorting.

But remember, unlike buying a stock where you have limited losses (stock goes to $0) and unlimited gains (Stock goes to the moon🚀), shorting stocks essentially have the opposite effect. You have limited gains (stock goes to $0) however you do have unlimited and usually massive losses (Stock goes to the moon🚀).

In this situation here, if those 600k stocks were shorted at say $25 each, and the GME stock reached $230 per share, then the loss would amount to roughly (-$136,000,000). And again, saying that they shorted 600k shares is a conservative number. The shear number of shares they shorted is probably greater than 1.8m shares. 

With that said, the hedger either has to take an exorbitant loss; minimize payroll expenses, sell off their various assets to liquidate and increase cash, and apply other cost-saving and anti-bankruptcy techniques. 

OR they have the option of again buying back the shorted stocks and declaring bankruptcy, where they'll likely be bailed out by various government agencies.

But those won't likely ever happen. The companies that are shorting GME and related stocks have assets ranking in the multi Trillions (yes, trillion with a T) of dollars. They'll just take a fat L, disappoint a few clients, and move on.

And if you're an individual shorting Millions of dollars of GME, then you're are going to see one less Yacht in your collection.

Otherwise, if they buy back the stock (throughly short-squeezed), and with the tremendous buying pressure, we could (no joke) see this stock touch $2,000 and beyond. And if nothing crippling happens tomorrow, this will surpass $1,000 per share.

This is wild.</text>

    <text>That makes sense. the hedge funds bet the stock would go down, and when it goes up instead they have to pay their losses. I’m sure I’m not wording that correctly but anyway makes sense to me</text>

    <text>And your point is?

Amazon trades where it’s at based on its business and reported earnings.

GameStop is trading where it’s at based on a ton of people realizing big investment firms shorted the stock and bet against it on borrowed money.</text>

    <text>The way the marketplace is operating ensures checks and balances. If the investment management team cannot cover their losses AFTER they have liquidated their assets, the brokers of these firms are held liable. If the brokers cannot cover the the losses of their clients AFTER they liquidate their assets, companies (very elusive) known as clearinghouses are held liable. 

Is it possible? Theoretically. Probable? Unlikely. Brokers have SHIT TONS of assets.</text>

    <text>No, that’s a different concept. Normal shorting can lead to more than 100% of stocks being shorted. 

Naked shorting is when you short without borrowing first. That can be possible because you don’t have give the stock the same instance you sell. 

That is illegal, because you artificially increase supply and thus lower the price. A series of fast naked shorts thus allow you to profit from the decrease in prize that the shorting itself is causing.</text>

    <text>The way I understand it. Is the hedge fund folks borrow a bunch of stocks and then sell them immediately.  They hope to rebuy the stocks later at a much lower price and then return the stocks to the lender and pocket the difference.   So if the stock price goes up, they won’t be able to return them to the lender unless they rebuy the stocks at the higher price.</text>

    <text>Ah I didn't consider the interest rates, that makes more sense now. Thanks. One more question: I've already read reports detailing an estimated combined loss of $70 Billion from investors. How can $70 Billion dollars be lost already if people are still waiting for market normalisation to buy back their shares?</text>

    <text>It’s very possible. When you buy a stock in the traditional sense, it has unlimited potential to grow. Short selling is the opposite: unlimited potential to lose money. While I don’t know what exactly happens if you can’t pay, I imagine any trading platform has you agree to pay them in their TOS. If you can’t pay, they would likely sue to have your wages garnished.</text>

    <text>Hedge funds were attempting to profit off of businesses failing, which is morally sketchy in my opinion. The short squeeze that people are doing is an attempt to profit at the sake of the hedge funds doing the short sell. Even if the average person isn't making a profit, I think they'll be happy that they're costing the hedge funds a lot of money and making them realize that they aren't safe from the average person in spite of their hundreds of billions of dollars. 

By shutting down the ability for average people to buy, they're essentially picking the winners and losers in the market. They're deciding that they want the hedge funds to profit and not the average person. That's literally market manipulation by controlling the outcome of the situation by abusing their power.</text>

    <text>Honest question though.  Is this at all dangerous for the market in general.  I know we all despise hedge fund managers, but clearly these companies have money tied up in other places, right?  All the hedge funds going bankrupt would have an adverse impact on the market, right?

It's a funny meme right now to see all the billionaires bitching and crying and I love it.

    <text>The way I understand it is:

**Shorting**:

Invester borrows 5 stocks for $2 each then sells to 5 "people" for $2 each knowing they will drop in price. He/she then buys them back when they drop to say $1 and then returns the stocks to who he/she borrowed from. That investor now has the $1 difference per stock (there is % interest and stuff but to make things easy we will omit that)

**How they lose money**:

If the stock goes **UP** in value the investor still has to return the stocks they borrowed and will have to pay back the difference no matter how much it goes up. So in this example the stocks are now $4 a share and to buy them back he/she is down $2 each share and is legally obligated to return what he/she borrowed so needs to take the loss. 

I'm new to this too though.</text>

    <text>I'm in STEM and have no skin in the game about all this going on. Hell, I've been fantasizing about what my life would be like if I had had the vision of DFV. But, I'm not really into investing as it's not my core competency. 

I just think back to a story I heard when I was a kid about JFK's father. He was heavily invested in the stock market in the 20s when everything was high. He decided to get out (before the crash) because a kid shoe shine started giving him supposed stock tips - and he thought too many people involved didn't know what they were doing. It recently happened in China too, where everyone was putting everything they had into the market without doing any DD because everyone saw how hot it was, and then it crashed because things were overvalued and a lot of people lost everything.

I hope everyone makes their money and I hope the losers don't lose much, as you say. But I think when this all scaled out beyon WSB and started being the front page of /all, it started reaching a much larger audience and the rhetoric about it all has been unflappably positive...which, as I say, might be dangerous. But I want to clarify...I don't really care what happens to the market or the hedge funds, I just think people might get burned in the end and not see it coming through all of these rose-colored glasses.</text>

    <text>Immoral? Yes. Hedge funds engaging in short selling are immoral because they’re literally manipulating markets.

Illegal? No. Because they’re the ones in power lol.

In terms of WSB, it’s neither illegal or immoral. It’s just a group of people deciding to buy stocks. That’s literally what the stock market is for. But it’s framed as immoral because they’re bankrupting a hedge fund in the process.

    <text>Even with both buy and sell orders, this behaves absolutely nothing like the real stock market.

It's a convenient lie that how big traders make their money is buying things they think will go up and selling things they think will go down.

In reality, the market is mostly based on things much more complicated than this. The current events are driven by short sellers - people selling things they borrowed and don't actually own (and must return at some point). Why this nonsense is happening is that people borrowed-and-sold stocks that they while need to return at such a large rate that it could cause a shortage of those. WSB believes they are making money by owning the in-demand stocks during that shortage.

While not so related to the reason this thread is here, derivatives, which are basically any financial instrument whose value depends on the value of the assets but is not buying-or-selling the actual stock is a huge, huge part of the financial markets. These can be a million different things, but obvious examples are options (where you buy or sell the ability to buy or sell a stock in future) or futures/forwards (which I won't explain now). Huge parts of the financial industry is based on these more complex instruments.</text>

    <text>A few ways. Beyond illegal methods (forcibly selling the stock for less, closing accounts with the stock, or market manipulation (like not allowing you to buy the stock, which is happening right now)), if enough stocks get owned by brokers, and they work together, they could theoretically get back all the stocks they shorted and reinvest. However, this is also most likely illegal depending on interpretations of the law. So long as they own enough of the stock, and refuse to sell, the price will only go up as people realize that if they are the only seller, they can put it at whatever price and be selling for the lowest.</text>

    <text>From what I understand the hedge funds were shorting the GME stock, which is basically promising to buy a stock at lower price that what it’s worth. Which drives the price down and they can then profit massively. They drove GameStop down like 140% I think? Basically betting on ruining the company for a cheap profit. 
Someone on the wsb page realised this and saw an opportunity to make money off the hedge funds by driving the price up by buying shares and telling the subreddit to buy</text>

    <text>The orders by buyers and sellers go into something called an order book. This is maintained by the Market Makers who provide enough liquidity so that transactions can actually happen. Robinhood, fidelity and other brokers route your orders through these market makers. They basically match buyers to sellers. So in this case, there will be an order list. It might be something like: Buy 3 shares at $20, 10 shares at $20.05 and so on. It will also have a sell side. Sell 3 shares at $20.02, 5 shares at $20.10 and so on. So the market makers match these orders and then the price changes.</text>

    <text>There's a finite number of shares. You ask around and try to figure out the cheapest rate anybody in town is selling the stock for and buy it at that rate. If you are a stock owner looking to sell you want to sell at the highest possible price. If you are looking to buy you want to buy at the lowest possible price. The prices of trades are proposed and shot down constantly, and occasionally people agree on a deal. This all happens extremely fast to the point where you can just know second by second what the going rate will be for a sale that both sides will agree to.</text>

    <text>Alright, this finally made clear what I had been missing: it's the *number of shares* which is being borrowed, and traded and re-bought, yes?

If I borrow 100 shares from you and do whatever voodoo I do with it, if I return 100 shares to you, you are made whole regardless of how the dollar value of the stock has changed in the interim, correct?</text>

    <text>Imagine a place that has a common notice board, like a dormitory.

Let's say I have a basketball, and I want to sell it for $10, I put a note on the board saying "Basketball $10". Anyone could reach out and take my offer, and buy my item for $10. 

On the reverse, if I wanted to buy a basketball, I could post a notice that says "want to buy basketball - $9" and similarly anyone who wants to could take that offer and sell me a basketball for $9.

Now imagine this is a very large dorm, with lots of basketballs changing hands, and dozens of people are posting notices of balls their buying and selling at certain prices. I post my original offer for $10, someone else wants $11 for theirs, and someone else is interested in buying but they won't spend more than $9. Eventually someone comes along and wants a basketball, and they grab whichever offer is the lowest, mine at $10. Now the next person who wants a basketball will have to take my neighbors offer for $11. If the demand for basketballs is high, and more people are buying then selling, the guy offering to buy one for $9 might never see anyone willing to take his offer, since everyone with a basketball can get more money selling to someone else.

This is how the stock market works, people post prices they are willing to buy and sell for on exchanges. Eventually the buyers and sellers find a middle price that none of the sellers are willing to sell for, and none of the buyers are willing to buy for. 

You can post any price you want, though if you're really far from the middle then you might never get somebody to take your offer. I could post an offer right now, to buy $GME for $1, but nobody would take me up on it. 

So the TLDR of your question, whenever the cheapest offer to sell something has been bought, the price now become the next lowest offer that's been posted. Similarly, if a lower price gets posted, then that becomes the price.</text>

    <text>Cause they are betting on the stocks going up. If the stocks goes up what happened is that they will get the different in price between the closing price and their buy price + still have ownership of the share. 

Reason being when you short a stock, you need to sell the share back to the original owner. Hence why in GME case, people can just buy in and they won’t lose money as long as there are more buys. This is because Melvin Capital shorted 139% of the share. Like they shorted all of GME stocks. 

If Melvin shorted only 40% of the stocks which is still fucking a lot, this current discussion of hedgefund ba redditors will take a different view imho. But because they shorted all of GME stocks and more they need to pay up if the price of the stocks goes up. They can’t hold long because as they hold they are being charged interest and it will come to a point where the interest is higher compared to their loss. 

So basically the Eli5 is when you short a stock, you are betting on the company failing. When you buy a stock, you are betting on the company growing.</text>

    <text>The reason it continues rising is because the shorts outstanding. Hedge funds are continuing to open short positions. These positions have infinite risk. 

When the short position closes, a bunch of shares are purchased to cover the position. This can create a large rise in share price. 

I do not think this is over. If enough people hold on to their shares long enough, we will see a very large number of shares being purchased from these short positions, increasing the stock price.

    <text>A few things to unpack here. 

1. You don't know what the original owner (OO) paid for the stock. They could have bought it for $1 when it first came out. Then it's worth $20. There's no real gain for them until they sell the shares. 

Here comes a borrower who thinks the price will go down. They 'borrow' the shares. They pay interest to OO.  OO can watch the price drop to $10 and not care....they bought at $1.

2. Just because OO loans out the shares, doesn't lock them into waiting. They can still arrange for another shareholder to step into their shoes. Now the new party collects the interest, and OO is out of the market.</text>

    <text>Shorts themselves also push stock values down by creating an excess of availability in the market. If you put yourself in a significant enough short position, that position itself can affect the price and make you a return.

    <text>It’s a contract, the shares have to be paid back to whoever they borrowed from. 

If they don’t have the shares, the hedge funds’ broker dealer will liquidate other investments the hedge fund has and buy the shares on the open market.   If there’s not enough there, the broker dealer is on the hook for it.  

That’s why the broker dealer won’t let it go to that.   As the share price increases, the potential loss to the short positions increases.   At certain levels of exposure, the broker dealer will issue a margin call against the hedge fund meaning the hedge fund needs to put more money in their broker dealer account.</text>

    <text>The thing about shorting a stock is that the potential losses are infinite. That is not hyperbole. It is a bet that a company's stock will fail. If it rises, you lose your short bet, and there is no ceiling to a rising price. It is simply a matter of how long people can hold. If the squeeze happens, and they offer 1k per share, people could take that, and some will. But if enough say no, then they make another offer. Maybe 2k. Maybe they hold still.  

The issue is it's a lot of people holding. Some would take 1k and run. Some would take 2k and run. Some may even take 500 when it gets there, before the squeeze even happens. Or maybe they are all dragged through the mud and shit on by hedge fund billionaires and media analysts and life in general that they all stare at them and hold for 10k. Not likely. But all that matters is that people hold until the squeeze. Once the squeeze happens, they literally get to name their price.</text>

    <text>An option is pretty much exactly that, an option to do something.

The key is an option gives you the option to control 100 shares of something. 


You have a lot of Pokemon cards, I want Pokemon cards. Right now, Pikachu cards sell for $8 per card. I think Pikachu cards are going to take off in value, I think they'll easily be worth $15 soon. You think Pikachu cards are worthless pieces of crap...at best worth under $10. 


You tell me that for 47 cents per card, you'll sell me the option to buy 100 Pikachu cards from you for $10 per card on March 5th (options expire on Fridays). So I give you $47 (47 cents x 100 cards). You've just sold me a call option. I've bought a call option. 1 PIKA 3/5 10C


For the seller, if the price of Pikachu cards stays under $10, things work out great for you! You get to keep your Pikachu cards, AND you pocket the $47 I gave you for the option. On the other hand, on March 5th, if the value is above $10 (doesn't matter if it's at $12, $15, or $200), you have to sell me those 100 cards for $10 each. So you'll make $1,047 ($10 per card, as well as 47 cents per card)....but it would really hurt to sell me them that cheap when they're worth way more than that. I am happy though, because I was able to buy the cards for far less than I could otherwise. 



Puts are similar, but it is an offer to buy. You want to buy Charizard cards to add to your collection. They cost $25 right now, but you think they're going to go way up in value by March 5th. You tell me that for $1.20 you'll give me the option to sell you 100 cards on March 5th for $25. I really like that deal, because I think they're about to go way down in value. I give you $1200 ($1.20 x 100) and go on my way. You've sold a put option, and I've bought one. 


March 5th rolls around. If the price is over $25, you win. I'm not going to use my option because I can sell for more elsewhere, so you keep $1200 that I paid you. But say the price fell to $10. You have to give me $2500 for what is only $1000 worth of cards. 



This is pretty simplistic and left out a ton, but its a pretty basic look at it.</text>

    <text>An option is a contract between a buyer and a seller to exchange 100 shares of stock at a certain price on or before an agreed upon date. The buyer of the contract pays a fee (called premium) to the seller. Once payed, the buyer reserves the right to exercise the contract any time on/before the expiration date. The seller always keeps the premium but only has to exchange the shares if the buyer exercises (which ~80% of the time they don't) 

A call option is where the contract buyer reserves the right to purchase shares at a set price from the contract seller. So say I bought a 2/19 50 call for Gamestop for $500. I reserve the right to buy 100 shares of Gamestop at 50 dollars each any time between now and Feb 19. Since I paid 500 for the contract, any price over 55/share (500 contract price/100 shares + my strike price of 50) would be profitable and I could exercise the contract and take the shares. Between 50 and 55 I take a partial loss by exercising and below 50 the contact is worthless and I'd eat a bigger loss taking the shares. Calls are purchased when you think a stock will rise. 

A put option is the exact opposite of a call option. The buyer reserves the right to sell shares at a set price to the contract seller. If we used the same figures for a put contract, below 45 is where I'd make money, between 45 and 50 I'd lose some money, and over 50 the contract is worthless. Puts are purchased when you think a stock will fall.

Now options don't have to be exercised. They have value that fluctuates based on various factors during the day. So one can trade them just like any stock. Their appeal is their leverage. I can buy an option contract for less than what it would cost to buy 100 shares. Their down fall is they come with an expiration date. I buy stock and it doesn't move in my favor, I still have the shares. An options contract that doesn't move in my favor is worth 0.</text>

    <text>In absolute layman’s terms it’s when you have an option to buy a stock at a certain price in the future. Stock is $100 today and you put an option to buy at $105 tomorrow when you’re really thinking it’ll be trading at $140 tomorrow. Someone believes the price will actually go down and takes you up on your bet so to speak. He is hoping the price goes down to $90 tomorrow but still can sell it to you at $105 tomorrow. 

That is not the entirety of it but in a very crude sense</text>

    <text>Options trading is trading contracts (50 shares, 100, 1000, etc) that have a time limit until the contract either needs to sold or covered. Usually covering means paying your broker a fee to extend your contract. Selling means you sell the contract. If you place a call option, you are saying that you are going to buy x amount of shares at a certain price. People try to place calls at prices below what they think the future value of the share is going to be. Puts mean you sell x amount of shares at a certain price in the intent of selling shares at a price valued higher than what the stock is worth. This is where shorting comes from. Shorting means you think a stock is going to be worth less than the price you agreed to on the contract.</text>

    <text>Thanks, good explanations.

Probably oversimplifying some concepts here but: What role does the amount of outstanding shares have in the GME situation? Could GameStop have settled the rally somewhat by putting more shares into the market, allowing the fulfillment of options? It seems like brokerages halting trades would be the worst possible outcome and they'd be compelled to do something if they have some control over the number of shares, even if it does devalue the price it seems like it wouldn't be a big deal after a $300 rise.</text>

    <text>Call option is a contract that the owner holds the right to buy 100 shares of a stock at a certain price (strike price) no matter what the current price of the stock is. A put is a contract that the owner holds the right to sell 100 shares of stock at a certain price no matter what the current price is. So if I own a call option that you sold me with a $60 strike price you have to sell me 100 shares at $60 per share even if the current price of the stock is $150. If I own a put that you sold me with a strike price of $60 you have to buy 100 shares at $60 per share even if the price is $10.</text>

    <text>I think with options you can technically sell stock that you don't own (that's how it got to 140% of existing shares sold). So they could have owned zero stocks  planning to slowly buy/trade their obligations--but now they're contractually obligate to trade a *ridiculous* amount of stock that they don't (and can't own, because hardly anyone is selling. Plus there's no way to get 40% more than 100%).</text>

    <text>This is the real crime. They never existed in the first place. It's all made up. 140% of the shares were short sold. This was sort of bound to happen. They created the situation. People buying stock aren't bad guys. They're just buying shares. The broker allowed short sellers to make literally infinite risks indefinitely.</text>

    <text>Various brokerage firms lend the hedge funds the shares. In this case it was probably the prime brokers for these hedge funds - basically companies that provide services to hedge funds, things like cash management and securities custodial services (i.e. actually holding the shares for the hedge fund).

They’re going to make interest on all these loans. They’ll make bank from the squeeze in the sense that the longer it takes the hedge funds to close the positions, the longer they collect interest.</text>

    <text>In the case of GME, is the problem that there are too few outstanding shares or sellers available to fulfill options? Couldn't GME have averted the freeze by brokers and lack of availability by issuing more shares and taking advantage of this rally by allowing it to continue? Surely someone would anticipate an issue with their outstanding share amount? It seems like offering more shares around or before the peak would be safer than allowing a subsequent collapse?

Great explanation btw, thanks. That site is good too. Is the issue visible just in the numbers on that tracker or is there more to it?</text>

    <text>No not really bc this will all come crashing down. If your a small time employee then yeah you can sell, if your an executive with a company you can't just sell shares you have to give notice and have to wait a timeframe to sell and by that time this will all be over.</text>

    <text>Sure, but my understanding is that a big financial institution like Citadel is mostly moving around "other people's money". So this begs the question, whose money is it primarily? Or does it really belong to the owners of Citadel? Put another way, if a hedge fund loses/wins big, who does that hurt/help besides the managers who are credited with making a bad/good decision?</text>

    <text>They could, but haven't at least yet. For example, AMC, which had a siilar but smaller run up, did a secondary and convertible offering to raise  $300 million for its balance sheet. Tesla did something similar this summer. They just sold new shares on the open market. GME would have to file with SEC and hire a bank to sell the shares.</text>

    <text>Your answering the question yourself. It’s the law of supply and demand. 

If the hedge funds desperately need the stock in order to cover their short, they will be forced to bid ferociously for the few remaining sharrs up for auction. 

Right now its a mexican standoff. The WSB crowd have bought up so many shares in the hope that when the hedge funds obligations come due, the price, due to supply and demand is incredible.</text>

    <text>Options (puts and call) have expiration dates, shorts don’t.  Shorts cost fee, usually daily.  If redditors, etc. 💎🤚 and stick to $5000, hedge funds will have to fill the in-the-money calls upon expiration, requiring them to buy at market-dictated price.  For shorts, they will either have to keep paying “borrowing” fee on the stocks they shorted, hoping the price drops, or buy the stocks at market-dictated price.</text>

    <text>The price is determined based off of what people are willing to sell it for (the ASK price). Thus, if everyone agreed to set an ask price of $5000, theoretically that could happen. However, coordination failure is common in economics so that would never work.</text>

    <text>They can't really sell easily as the stock holders are insiders and there is a lot of regulation about that. The same with issuing new stock. They have some already in train to issue quickly but it won't be enough to cover the shorts. If they do issue it'll help them cover their debts, and offering them new options as a company in terms of next steps and direction.</text>

    <text>So the big story going around is that Ken Griffin from Citadel owns Robinhood and told Robinhood to halt trading on GME because citadel was over leveraged on a massive GME short. This is not true. Citadel does not own RH. They pay for order flow at RH like many firms do. There is no ownership interest and there is no one but RH calling the shots. 

What happened... pretty simple. 

Customers have margin accts. RH let customers open long positions at ridiculous prices. RH stopped all customers out when prices dropped back down. RH is then on the hook and has to collect a buttload of money from a buttload of people. 

This has happened before, and IBKR did the smart thing and just wrote down the loss knowing they wouldn’t be able to collect everything. 

What RH SHOULD HAVE DONE was allow longs to be opened at full margin, but they DIDN’T because they’re STUPID.</text>

    <text>The holding is so that the hedge funds cant buy the shares, not so that it wont sink again. The Hedge funds cant artificially lower the price by shorting and stopping the stock repeatedly in big chunks, but if no one panics and sells, they wont actually buy any shares and will only be wasting money with their chunks of new short positions.

They're also telling people to buy so that there will be less shares available on the market from sellers. If someone buys who won't sell, the available shares is reduced and the squeeze will happen sooner.</text>

    <text>If a forum of random individuals yelling at each other to buy a specific stock is considered manipulation, then all financial shows, podcasts, and websites that give out Stock advice would be considered manipulating stocks.

So there goes Motley Fool, Cramer, essentially anyone that tells anyone in public that a stock is a good buy.

Oh, buy ratings? Those would be manipulative.

It can't be as simple as "anyone who discusses stocks is manipulating the market".

The real problem? Hedge funds being able to short more than 100% of a company's available stock. Another real problem? Hedge funds colluding with brokers to halt one side of a trade in order to allow them to exit the other side.</text>

    <text>They profit through what's called Order Flow

You buy through Robinhood for $10, but Robinhood doesn't actually buy the stock. Robinhood makes a deal with John C BigMoney to direct all of their client trades through him. With all of that buying power, John BigMoney gets a better deal, he buys the stock for $9.50. John BigMoney then sells the stocks he just bought to Robinhood for $9.75, and pockets his 25 cents. Robinhood then sells it to *you* for the original $10, and pockets their own 25 cents.</text>

    <text>I want to clarify two things:

1. The squeeze height is predictable with enough data. Level 2 market data provides the limit order book for cheap if not free on some platforms. Making some unreasonable assumptions, (no one puts in stop losses, everyone puts in a limit sell higher than X, no margin), them the squeeze *has* to at least reach X, or whatever makes the shorters go bust. You can roughly extrapolate the minimum squeeze hieght from such information, but it's a complex calculation that I don't think people know the full formula, and will require some ML of previous short squeezes and historical data to determine.

2. Historically (volkswagen), the price did not *immediately* go back to the fundamentals. Even disregarding the squeeze, people still made out like bandits after at several hundred a share.

This is not financial advice.</text>

    <text>1. Everyone keeps saying the number 130% (shorts) since last friday. Haven't they offloaded some of them since now? Isn't it reasonable that a lot of people closed their positions asap, especially during the dive today?

2. Do all shorts need to be bought? According to this site https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme (I may be interpreting things wrong), but there is a short volume of 9,606,123. How is *everyone* going to be able to sell at "squeeze price" if only 10m need to be bought? The volume traded is was over 50M today and higher other days.</text>

    <text>No, it's market tactic.... not manipulation.

There is certainly lots of gray areas.... but a "short squeeze" which is what WSB did, has been a valid and legal tactic used by Wall Street firms in the past. 

From wiki... on Manipulation

&gt;Market manipulation is a type of market abuse where there is a deliberate attempt to **interfere** with the free and fair operation of the market and create **false** or misleading appearances with respect to the price of, or market for, a product, security or commodity.

So if you **lied** about something.... say the earnings report of a company, this would not only be misleading investors, but manipulating the market to increase the value of stocks.

Second key point, if you interfered in some way to prevent the selling or purchasing of stocks... by like... IDK.... freezing the buying of certain stocks with an app.... this would be interfering with the market and by definition manipulation, especially if it can be proven that someone gained from the action.</text>

    <text>The problem is there are lawsuits already being filed against Robinhood and by congress people. They see reddit itself as being an entity and mods of wsb as the manipulators telling people on the subreddit to go out and buy the stock and intentionally drive up the price. If I recall, the main reason this all began was because a guy wanted to pay off his student loans and went all in on $GME and came out on top as people started to buy stock to drive up the price. That was back when shares were only a few bucks.</text>

Which is kinda the point, nowadays thanks to technology, everyone can do this at any time. Theres a whole part of this that us fuck Wallstreet suit wearing assholes 'we' can manipulate shit too.


The hatred towards these giant hedge funds and whatever comes from the fact that a lot of people feel like betting against a company (or betting on them to fail) is pretty morally questionable. And also these funds weren't available to the Average Joe. Only the ultra rich (I get chauffeured in a Bentley kinda rich) and whole retirement funds and etc got into them. And they still kinda aren't smarter than the average bear. But get paid millions. Its just fucked up.</text>

But if you say some dumb shit based on no facts what so ever cause you have a smooth brain but include "this is not financial advice" its much harder for the SEC to say you weren't acting in good faith because you told people you weren't trying to give them advice. But it's also a meme because the SEC can suck my left nut anyway</text>

    <text>Shorting in and of itself is fine, it's really a fairly basic tenet of stock trading. When you buy and sell stock for personal investment using your own money, the idea is to buy low and sell high, pocketing the difference. Shorting is just that in reverse essentially, only using someone else's stock, where you sell high and hope to buy back low, also pocketing the difference.</text>

    <text>ALSO use sell limit orders. You can set the price you want to sell at, and it’ll fill the order automatically. That way you don’t miss the spike.</text>

    <text>A "hedge fund" is just a private investment company. If you offer to manage money for the general public, there are tons of regulations to keep you from taking too much risk. However, if you start a private company and only take money from institutions or the mega rich, you're not subject to those regulations, because presumably those institutions know what they're doing, and the mega rich can afford to take the losses.</text>

    <text>My take is that AMC was also shorted big time just like GME. So the same thing is happening there just faster because we already know how this works.


BB is different. They got a big deal with amazon and people think they will make a lot of money from self driving cars. Who knows. I think Nokia piggybacked on blackberry and its all getting jumbled into this mess.</text>

    <text>A hedge (as in hedge your bets) is a valid market stability kind of operation. 

Hedge funds started in the same way. There's better answers on Reddit on how a restaurant serving pork sandwiches can spend 50$ to hedge against price of pork going up, via a futures contract, or a put option, or other derivatives that tie in to pork prices. 

There are two questions...

A/ markets are efficient when there is liquidity and competition. Imagine a world where social media isn't liquid and, say, Facebook actively stifles competition by buying up WhatsApp and Instagram and others. It can then unilaterally make changes to TOS and affect the whole social media landscape like a monopoly. I know it's hard, but just imagine if that were the case. ^/s

B/ Leveraging - this is when you make bets that aren't limited to the money you put in but 2x or 5x or 20x that. It is meant to exploit arbitrages of, say, 5 cents or so that would otherwise be uneconomical to exploit. On paper, it is supposed to smooth out small fluctuations. But if you lose you lose a _lot_ more. 

Leverages are a nice way to hedge well. But leverages mean you can end up betting far more than liquidity allows, so you end up affecting the market. The market is then overleveraged and loses liquidity and hence efficiency.

Many countries do ban certain forms of derivatives, or require proper professional qualifications. 

I mentioned that hedge funds started in the same way. They've now evolved from defensive safeguards on your investment to active offensive overleveraged bets.</text>

    <text>Shorting can be thought of as a contract where the buyer will pay the future price of a stock in exchange for borrowing money right now at the current stock price.

As this is basically a form of gambling or insurance, it is a natural byproduct of having a market, where you can gamble/buy insurance on a wide variety of outcomes.

Notice how gambling and insurance are linked? This is about providing a way to offset risk.

Right now there are a whole bunch of hedge funds that are coming to grips with the fact that they did not adequately assess the risk of a large campaign of advertising to pump the market price of a certain stock. 

Something special about shorting however, is that it uses actual stocks themselves, rather than just the share price. This makes for extra risk and cost, because you need to find actual shares to short, and then to buy again, not just rely on the price shown at market.</text>

    <text>The calculation in your head should be what am I willing to risk to be part of what could be a historical moment. And it still has the ability to be a good financial decision if the amount of shorts expiring are large enough to overwhelm the available stock thus creating an effective squeeze. I would Google historically short squeeze so that you can at least recognize what the "goal" is for your investment.</text>

    <text>A broker will lend the stock that regular people like you or I own to the borrower/short seller.

The short seller expects the price to go down and so sell it at current market price (say $10).

They wait for the price to fall and when its time to return the borrowed stock they buy it back for the new market price (say $5).

Thus profiting off the difference, while the broker receives interest for loaning it.

The actual owner is relatively unaffected.</text>

    <text>But what is it exactly? I want to understand how it works in practice. Is it like.... I borrow stocks from someone, and sell them immediately (then wait for the price to fall so I can buy them back, return them, and pocket the difference). Then the person who bought them lends them to someone else, who sells them immediately (then waits for the price to fall, so he can buy them back, etc) and so on..... this is making my head spin.</text>

    <text>Usually other shareholders. No one really knows where the top is going to be until it passes. Some sell cause they believe the top is reached other buy cause they believe it will go higher. 


The other thing is that there are different investing strategies based on what time frame you want to make a profit. Some people may just buy it high and won't care cause they plan on holding it for the long term and an initial dip right after they buy it may be scary but the stock will ultimately bounce back, (given the company is good).


What's happening right now is different though. The hedge funds borrowed the stock and sold it, now they have to return it. They have to buy the stock because their obligated to do so by their contracts.</text>

    <text>Yes that is the point.

However, the shorts have an expiration date and once it expires, the shorters have to start paying interest on their shorts. If we hold long enough, they will start paying very very large sums of money to get any available shares. Inevitably people will sell, the shorts will cover, and it’s all over.</text>

This means the hedgefund has to sell their borrowed stock back at a loss...major loss. Not only is a piece of shit place losing money but folks here on reddit are turning in to millionaires from it. The fatcats over at Wallstreet sre incredibly unhappy about this because they very like also placed their bets on Gamestop doing poorly. Basically average joes are getting wealth and fatcats are losing billions. All because the strange folks over at WSB decided to do something about it. Its truly one for the history books.</text>

    <text>Combination of chicken and prisoner's dilemma.

Price based on what a buyer is willing to sell at and a seller is willing to pay . So for the same demand, if lots of people are selling, the price goes down. If very few people selling, they can ask for and get a higher price, especially if the buyer MUST buy.

So, if most hold, the price gets higher and higher.

If the buyers (eg Melvin capital) goes bankrupt, then that obligation can be closed without share , so people who still have the share or got it at a high price are left holding the bag

If the short seller can get enough stocks from the market , to cover their short sales, then the demand can collapse and again  people holding on are left with stocks as prices crash</text>

    <text>Because they pay a rate (interest) everyday the stock is above the short strike (price).   They can wait it out as long as the have liquid capital to sell off to pay off the interest of borrowing the stock.   The problem is, there aren’t many shares available for the hedge funds to buy in the first place, and remember they continue to pay everyday the stock is above their strike price.   So essentially it’s a waiting game, but the wsb crowd and others aren’t selling off scared yet.</text>

    <text>Because of the way short selling works (you're basically borrowing a share, selling it immediately, and rebuying it later, hopefully for cheaper), gamestop was massively overshorted which allowed people to get together, buy and hold the stock ensuring it doesn't go down and short sellers are now being forced to fulfil their promise of buying the share, but since there's no one selling the shares then the stock price sky rockets, which is whats known as a short squeeze</text>

    <text>Media is trying to scare people into selling GME or not buying it. They are trying to demonize regular folks that just like GME and wanna buy it.

Retirement funds are not hurt at all by GME since they are not short GME. If anything, some funds might be holding GME and benefit.

Retirement funds are NOT hedge funds. They are completely different.

Retirement funds can NOT invest in hedge funds.

Retirement funds can use some tools that some hedge funds use, but that is because the person that owns the retirement fund is doing it themselves and for their own retirement fund. It has nothing to do with everyone else's retirement funds.

Don't believe any of the hit pieces all media is doing on the little guys that buy GME.</text>

    <text>Except this has been going on for weeks and average joes have been buying very short dated OTM calls on GME that have all gone ITM.  It's a big reason why GME keeps going up - due to gamma squeeze.  There are lot of average joes who've made a killing because value of short dated options have exploded. WSB thing is literally buying extreme high risk 0DTE to 1 week expiry contracts. Those have been printing money over the last month. You're wrong.</text>

    <text>&gt;Are retirement funds hurt by this GME fiasco?

Probably not. It also depends on what you mean by retirement funds. If you mean mutual funds that you own in your IRA or a 401(k) plan at work, here is (probably a partial) list of mutual funds etc that own GME shares. If you own one of these funds, calculate how much GME it holds relative to its total portfolio size. https://fintel.io/somf/us/gme

&gt;Are retirement funds hedge funds?

If, again, you are talking about IRAs and 401(k)s, no, they are not hedge funds.

&gt;Can retirement funds invest in hedge funds?

Some can and do--and that should be disclosed in the fund's prospectus--but typically they do not. 

&gt;Can retirement funds use high risk investment methods and tools like hedge funds do?

Yes, but rarely to the extent or degree that hedge funds do. Again, check your mutual fund's prospectus for specifics. Typically the prospectus will state the maximum amount of the fund's holdings to which such techniques (e.g. leverage, derivatives) can be applied.</text>

    <text>shorting a stock is like signing a contract to borrow shares, and then give them back at a later date. what the purchaser of a short expects is that they can borrow the shares, sell them immediately, wait for the price to go down, buy them back at a reduced price, then give them back to the source they borrowed in order to settle their loan. They make money from the difference between the price they initially sold at and the reduced price they eventually bought the shares back at. However, a short seller is faced with a problem when the price of the shares they borrowed goes up, instead of going down: the purchaser of the short then has to buy the shares back at an *increased* price in order to settle their debt, losing money. Technically, because the the price of a share can rise infinitely, people who buy short can be on the hook for theoretically infinitlely more than the original purchased the contract for</text>

Hedge funds are not retirement funds. They are for ultra wealthy people as they have extra risk (sort of an understatement here). Conversely retirement funds are usually ultra safe. They probably are required to buy government bonds (as safe as it gets) and are forbidden from shorting stock.</text>

    <text>&gt;Hedge funds are invested in a lot of different stocks and many of them have also shorted a lot of stocks, like GME. If they have to sell their stock in other companies to have enough money to pay the interest and losses on the short, that will cause the price of the stocks they sold to decline. Most of the hedge funds are all invested in a lot of the same stocks. They manipulate the market by each borrowing 10X their holdings and all focusing on a set of stocks, driving up the price or doing the same by shorting a set of stocks and driving it down. If they all have to sell their stocks to cover their shorts, the stocks they manipulated will decrease for everyone.

A hedge fund is a fund that implements an investment strategy that uses complex trading methods to almost guarantee high returns. Most retirement accounts do not invest in hedge funds. Most hedge funds are very difficult to get into and are often reserved for very high net worth individuals.</text>

    <text>Nah.  I'm not saying that gamestop is dying as a company or anything, they could do really well. But the reality is that right now, their stock price has nothing to do with performance. Also big time investors aren't going to hop on just because they do well one quarter, especially with all the media attention they're getting. If somehow gamestop managed to do really well three quarters in a row, then maybe the stock value will increase overall (to like $30, which is a lot more than they were) but never the price it's at now.</text>

    <text>Because for one they have to pay interest to the person they borrowed the stock from (in this case brokerages, which lend out the stocks they hold) based on the closing price that day. Brokers lending the shares also prefer to insure themselves against potential losses (if the stock goes up x10 in a day, how do they know whoever borrowed it will return it?) so they will call up their borrower and ask for the stock back or additional money in the account when the price keeps increasing past a certain limit. So the hedge funds had to either get the stock or put in more money.</text>

    <text>ELI5: Say your friend Abby borrowed your toy, you told her "I want this back in a week". You trust Abby, so you told Abby she can do *whatever* she wants to with your toy. 

So she sells it to Billy for $3. Now, she has $3 more than she did before. She guessed that Billy will be bored of it by the end of the week, and so she can buy it back for $1 just before she gives it back to you. She would have made $2.

The end of the week is tomorrow, and now, there are other people who are telling Billy "hey I want this toy, I'll give you $5 for it". Billy wants to make money, so he'll definitely sell it for $5. 

For her to get the toy back to you on time, she can't just wait it out. She has to buy it at whatever price she can. If other people are going to give Billy $5, then she has to buy it at that price.

If she doesn't, then you can take one of her toys in fairness.

ELI18: The stocks in this contract are coming due soon (IIRC Friday?), and if they don't have the stock back, the other companies can start liquidating their assets, depending on the details of the contract.</text>

    <text>This is misleading - you're not literally betting like at a casino. Shorting a stock simply means having some shares loaned to you (with interest and everything) which you then sell and must return to stop the interest from accruing. You're only "betting" in the sense that the only way you can make money from doing this is by having the price of shares go down.</text>

    <text>So a short is essentially a loan. They have to pay interest to maintain it. Today that interest was 250%... that’s not a good loan...

Also when they shorted the stock they borrowed shares at that current price to sell, ex.) shorted 10 shares at $10. They are in debt $100 to the brokerage firm. They hope the price can go down (say it goes to $1) so they can buy back those shares owed at the lower price to repay the brokerage and pocket the difference (10x1=10... 100 - 10 = $90 profit)... what happened here is the price ran up a ton. So when they borrowed 10 shares at $10 those shares are now $1000 and they owe the brokers $10,000. The brokerages HATE having unbalanced accounts like this as it puts them at huge risk because they’re forced to pay up if the short seller goes bankrupt. They can do a “margin call” and FORCE you to buy back those shares you owe at whatever price they are at no matter your losses or they will take your other stocks and sell them for $$. 

The bigger the gap between the price you shorted at and the current price the more likely you get margin called.</text>

    <text>A short means hedge funds borrowed shares and sold them to another person with an obligation that the hedge fund will buy the shares back at a certain date. On the day shares are due back to the lender, the hedge funds wins if the price of shares is lower than at the time of the original borrowing. 

Out simply, short sellers believe the stock will fall in price. They are required to pay back the shares they borrowed so if the price raises higher than when they borrowed you have a loss.</text>

    <text>Interest. They are on borrowing stocks to sell, and they have to pay interest. Hold longer, pay more.

Margin call. When they borrow, they have to deposit a certain deposit. When the stock price rise, they are less likely to be able to pay back, so they are required to put more money as deposit, or buy back stocks so they are borrowing less.

They are paying money every second, while everyone buying the stock can keep it until the end of time without paying anything.</text>

    <text>A naked short is selling something you don't have possession of. It's also a promise that you pay the difference in price at a latter date.

    <text>When you short a stock, you have shares of that stock loaned to you for an indefinite amount of time (until you return them). The loaner charges you interest over time, so every day the stock price doesn't go down means more interest you must pay and a lower price the shares of that stock must reach before you can break even. The indefinite-ness of this scares a lot of people because it means they could potentially keep losing money in interest forever, so they cut their losses early.</text>

    <text>So a short is essentially an options contract, and as such you are subject to margin calls. Margin calls are calls made by your broker, asking you to deposit money into your account, to cover the losses you are incurring at the moment. Remember an options contract is a zero sum game (one person always loses, when another one wins). 
So atm, wsb's thesis is that, if we keep the stock prices high enough for long enough, we can force them to either buy their shares at exorbitantly high prices, and make profit; or we can force the hedge funds into margin calls in the billions of dollars. So much so that they go bankrupt and their brokers are forced to liquidate the hedge fund's other positions to cover this one. 
Either way the hedge funds are going to pay an inflated price for this, as long as we can manage to keep the stock price high enough for long enough.</text>

They have to return the shares that they borrowed (aka pay the current price and return what they borrowed), or pay to continue to borrow them from the owner (interest on a debt).</text>

    <text>Because shorting involves borrowing shares, returning them later when the price drops, and pocketing the difference.  There are interest fees with the borrowing, so if they wait for the price to go down they might end up losing even harder.</text>

    <text>They opened their positions several months ago. 20 million contracts expire tomorrow with a striking price of under $5. These hedgefunds hold millions of these contracts agreeing to pay whatever the price of the stock is tomorrow, and they were betting that it would be under $5. Well, the price is about $300 so the short sellers owe about $295 per contract that expires tomorrow as of now. The real number will be shown once the market closes tomorrow.</text>

    <text>Let me make sure I understand since I know nothing about the stock market. So a short seller will ask person A to borrow their stock that's worth $10. Then the short seller can sell the borrowed stock to person B for $10. The stock drops to $5 and the short seller goes back to person A and pays them $5 for the stock they borrowed. And in this example the short seller makes a profit of $5 (minus whatever interest fees they paid for borrowing the stock)?</text>

Now, apple's disappear from the world and the only ones left are $1,000,000. The bank wants it's apple back because it doesn't trust you with a million dollar loan plus now you pay interest on a million dollars.

    <text>The short seller borrowing assumes the price with fall after they borrow and sell it, so they can buy it back later at a lower price and keep the difference.

The broker lending gets interest upon return and can receive commissions for providing the service to short sellers.</text>

    <text>They can’t wait. Every day that goes by they have to pay borrowing fees. And the price to cover (share price) keeps going up, cutting more losses for them. It’s a waiting game that only shareholders can win, since we pay nothing to delay the eventual squeeze.</text>

    <text>This is very true. The price at this point is incredibly inflated. Some of the biggest trends that pushed this price up are losing momentum (especially with brokerages / the sec potentially freezing trades) though it could continue to go up you're gambling that it will.. Though this was gambling from day 1. This *was* a genuinely once in a lifetime kind of movement. I wouldn't bank on finding more of these opportunities regardless of what people on the internet might tell you.</text>

    <text>1. So is the ideal outcome (for WSB) two-fold? Priority 1: wait long enough for all of the hedge funds to miss their deadlines and get financially screwed? Priority 2: Hope that once that happens, the stock is still so valuable that everyone can start cashing out and reaping their rewards?
2. We've seen how Robinhood/TD/etc are able to simply press a button and stop everyone from buying more stock. People say they'll get a light slap on the wrist, if anything from SEC. So what's stopping all of these banks/investors at the end of this whole debacle from *refusing to pay all of the WSB people who start trying to cash in?* Hasn't it already been observed and proven that WS can ultimately do whatever they want, and that the penalties of doing bad things are simply a small cost of doing business for them?</text>

    <text>Nothing is stopping that, other than bad accessibility for most. But lots of people are buying the stocks outside of Robinhood.

But most US retail investors don't have an account yet on other online brokers, and verification and deposits might take a while and many of them also stopped buying of the stocks. There's of course also more expensive brokers or brokers that only serve rich people that often have better access, and it should be possible to trade on the stock exchange directly, but I'm not sure how that works and how expensive that is.</text>

    <text>1) the impact to gamestop is minimal, people with shares in the company can cash out for a nice bonus, and the companies valuation going up brings some benefits

2) the hedges are in a tough spot, they either pay absurd prices now or hold out and hope they can ride this out, either way they're in the hole for billions

3) the idea of holding it is to make the short sellers desperate, because they're paying interest on those shorts, the longer this goes the worse it gets for them. You want to hold this until either the overall sentiment of the wsb buyers shifts to selling or until you think the price won't go any further up

4) hedges - either they manage to outlast the wsb buyers or get assistance from the powers that be

Reddjtors- hedges go bankrupt, price rockets into the thousands, reddits get massive paychecks

Gamestop- doesn't really have a dog in this fight, they're valuation is going up because of this which brings some small benefits but overall this shouldn't impact them</text>

    <text>So they've borrowed and then sold over 100% of the available shares. They don't want to buy those shares back and return them because they'll lose even more money since the price has gone up. So they keep borrowing and borrowing and selling and selling in the hope that other people see this and start to sell, driving down the price. But if people hold onto their shares there are not enough shares available to cover the difference when these shorts have to buy back the shares they've sold. 

Institutions can and do trade off buying and selling shares with each other and drive down the price to make it seem like other people are selling, it's called a short ladder. This happened today. Millions of people clearly couldn't buy so who was buying all the shares that were being shorted? Other institutions for the most part.</text>

    <text>Say a stock has 100 shares they shorted 140. Meaning that they borrowed a share, sold it to hopefully buy it back at a lower value and return the share. I dont know how this is possible but it happened. Also you may be wondering how they can buy these 140 shares back but because they borrowed it they will never own the share. And will basically by some shares twice</text>

    <text>Q1) The only relationship companies have with their stock is the board of directors, which is chosen by shareholders, and has power over decision-making at the company. The price of shares does not affect this.

Q3) In this case, the advantage to holding on to them is fucking over the people  who shorted.

Q4) Best case for hedge funds is people who are holding on to their shares start selling so the hedge funds can start giving back their loaned shares. Best case for redditors is that the hedge funds get fucked (and maybe everyone makes a little bit of money in doing so). The company couldn't care less, except maybe the free press they're getting.</text>

    <text>You are kind of right here but messed up a few things... when you short you borrow shares, and then sell them to the market.  You have to return shares to who you borrowed them from (you don’t return $).  When you borrow shares there is a borrow rate, that is the interest rate you pay to borrow the shares, that rate is different for each stock and fluctuates depending how “in demand” borrowing the stock is. 

(usually a very low % annually, but on heavily borrowed stocks that borrow rate goes up, I think on GME It is around an 80% borrow rate)</text>

    <text>1)    gamestop can sell more shares if they want, companies use the stocks of their company to make money. Likely most executives at the company own shares, and they are directly profiting from everything happening


2) hedgefunds use other people's money. They had to take out a loan to cover their loses. Basically they were trading levarged deals with infinite risk, thinking there's no way the stock will keep rallying. Whoever runs that hedgefund is likely losing their job and people with millions of dollars in retirement/ investment accounts lost money because of the sleeze tricks the hedgefund people do.  But those same people advocate for a free-unregulated market, so don't feel bad for any of them


3) advantage is that the hedgefunds *HAVE* to buy the stocks here soon, which is likely to drive the prices up even higher. (This is termed a short squeeze) Selling now will secure profits, but could miss out on the rally that is continuing to happen. The more people who hold, the more money it costs the hedgefunds who were shorting/manipulating the market.



4) this is different for each player. Best thing for reddit/investors and gamestop is for the stock to continue to go up. Higher stock prices help the people who already own them.


The best thing for the hedgefund would be for gamestop share prices to collapse so they can re-buy the shares they loaned/borrowed</text>

    <text>It’s arbitrary. Tesla did a 5:1 split so if you had 1 share at $100 before the split you then have 5 shares at $20 but you still own $100 in Tesla. 

Lower stock prices make it easier to buy for the everyday person who might not have $3000 to buy a share or who do not know how to do split shares

I don’t know if they are allowed to half the available shares, what if you owned an odd number of shares? But basically it’s the same concept</text>

A good sign that a company is doing well is a normal split. A recent notable split was Apple, from the top of my head, I think back in august their stock was around $500. What they did was, if you owned 1 share of apple, you would now own 4 shares of Apple, but at $125 each share.</text>

    <text>Umm, WSB does not engage in market manipulation at all. You should write your comment in a way that a cnbc anchor would never do. You comment is pretty shill like unfornately.

Edit: 

Lets see all the flaws with your comment.

You insulted the average retail investor.

You never bother to explain much at all

Your opinion favors whoever you are shilling.

You call it a bubble instead of a short squeeze because pump and dumps are illegal etc.

Are you trying to frame WSB as something the SEC will be unhappy with?</text>

    <text>When everyone owns a stock and they all sell it, this creates a panic of more and more people that think the price won’t go back up- and therefore they sell as well. When all these people sell their stocks, the supply of stocks increases meaning that the stock is less valuable</text>

    <text>WSB functioned as a quasi-hedge fund in it's own way. Reddit, as a collective, decided to take a position opposite the short, yet instead of pooling their money together into a fund, individual actors worked together. I'm not sure how that would be any different had a hedge fund done it.

I welcome you to contradict my positions. Let me know how normal people are protected when they paid 400 dollars for an asset that eventually will cost 17 dollars once again.</text>

    <text>It’s bad for the big companies - they’re losing money because they bet on stocks like GME to do poorly, and now that they are doing well they have to pay a price.

In this process, a company sells a stock they don’t have- then they promise to “cover” the cost in the future, when they predict the price will be less. However, these companies now have to cover at a MUCH higher cost, and these big companies have control over much of the world.</text>

    <text>It’s like the craps table at the casino. You might have 1 million dollars on the table, but it’s not your money until you take it off the table and put it in your pocket. The difference is you have to have someone who wants to take your position before you can remove your money. So you could have 5000 on 5 but if no one wants that 5 then you need to lower your price u til someone wants it and you might wind up with 1000 or 5 by the time it is accepted and that money is really yours.</text>

    <text>Great explanation, thank you. I have some further questions:

How can there be more "short positions" than there are stocks? Because surely then you have to pay back more stocks than exist... which is impossible?

How are the hedge funds able to not only speculate that the stocks will go down but also to actually make that happen? Like, how is that possible, but also how is that legal?

And finally - how does the value of a company's stock falling translate to real world implications for the business? If these hedge funds had got their way, would GameStop have gone out of business, and would it have been their fault?

Thanks.</text>

    <text>It depends on why they did it. Motive is the main factor in market manipulation.

Seeing as how the volume was insane, I’m almost certain that they did it to protect themselves from being overstretched and from running out of cash if the people trading on margin (IE all new accounts) don’t pay what they owe.</text>

    <text>The wsb guys trade in options. When you trade options, there is an exchange and you can classify them as the security guards.

The guards demand that you keep a certain % of your money in the bank everyday to prevent using money that you don't have.

The hedgies that shorted GME are in a greater risk since they have to have money in their accounts everyday to prevent the guards from taking over. This is known as margin call.

As the guy explained above, the hedgies cant cover their loss since GME price is really high. So, what do they do? They call other hedgies and provide them loans to prevent the guards from taking over... For now.

Moreover, You have to do this everyday to prevent the guards. This puts more pressure to you as your company goes into debt just trying to prevent the guards from coming in.

The reason why the wsb guys don't want to sell (realize their gains) is because they want the guards to take over to make a point about wall street greed and over leveraging what you don't have.</text>

    <text>You do own the stock, it's in your name regardless. No one else can claim that share
The issue then is how do you buy and sell the stock if it's in your pocket now? Do you then go back to the brokerage like a bank and deposit the stock to sell? You still need this trading platform, so it makes it easier for them to hold it. Also they use that value of the stock to show the SEC how much they are worth with all the investors assets combined.</text>

    <author>the_friendly_skeptic</author>
    <text>Hopefully this is helpful. I work in the stock market and my little brother asked me to explain what was going on. Here was my response: 

Let’s say GameStop has 100 shares outstanding currently trading @ $20 per share (so if you own 1 share, you own 1%, 25 shares = 25% and so on) 

That’s it. There are only 100 shares of GameStop. Throughout the day people are constantly buying and selling these shares for one reason or another (that’s why the stock price moves up and down constantly)

Now, typically when you think about making money in the stock market you typically think “buy low, sell high” 📈. In other words, buying Amazon when it was cheap, and now it’s worth 💰 💰 💰. In this case you would be speculating that the stock price of Amazon will go up ⬆️ in the future

- *fun industry term: you are  “bull-ish”*

Here is where the short selling comes into play. 

Let’s pretend You have a hedge fund. Alec’s hedge fund manager looks at GME (GameStop) and says “I think GME is over valued, it really should only be trading at $15 per share, not $20 🤔 “

In this situation, He is speculating that in the near future, the GME stock price will go down (to $15). 

- *another fun industry term; he would be “bear-ish” on GME*

Now since the hedge fund manager thinks GME’s stock price will go down, He is going to try to make money on that guess by short selling (shorting) the stock. 

To short the stock The manager is going to *borrow* some shares from someone else, bob, and sell them at the current market price (which is $20). 

Let’s say he borrows 10 shares (total of only 100 remember) and sells them at the New York stock exchange for $20. He made $200 ($20 x 10 shares)

A while later, GMEs stock price suddenly dips (fun industry term: “down ticks”). It is now trading at $15. 

Alec’s hedge fund manager was right! now don’t forget, we borrowed the shares from somebody else so we have to give those back. Alec’s hedge fund manager goes to the New York stock exchange and buys 10 shares @ $15 and returns those to the lender. 

Alec’s hedge fund made $50 on that trade total (this is called “PnL”).

So the full life cycle: 

- *Borrowed 10 shares from “bob”*
- *Sold 10 @ $20 in the market* 
- *Bought 10 @ $15 in the market*
- *Returned 10 shares to “bob”*

Total profit = (10 x $20) - (10 x $15) 


Okay.... so now onto what is actually happening with GameStop. 

Let’s keep the example the same. GameStop has 100 total shares outstanding. 

Now a bunch of hedge fund managers all think the exact thing that Alec’s hedge fund manager thought  so they all short the stock with the expectation that the price will “downtick” in the future. 

Here’s the thing.... someone on Reddit pointed out that despite the fact that GameStop only has 100 shares available at any given time, there were actually 125 shares on loan to cover short sales. 

I know this part is confusing, which it should be. That doesn’t make sense mathematically. How can you have more shares loaned out than available? I’m going to gloss over those details and just say that it is possible, and does happen on occasion. 

Now when you have a stock that is over shorted like this, you have one major risk, which is called a “gamma/short squeeze” . It does not occur often. 

In a gamma/short squeeze, there are more shares loaned out than available. That is because all of those hedge fund managers thought the price would go down and got greedy and tried to make as much 💰 as possible and over borrowed assuming they would be able to cover it. But, someone pointed that out on Reddit, and was able to get that information to go viral. Now with all of these new people buying the stock, it forced the stock price up, very quickly (supply and demand). 

Just like in the example, these hedge fund managers had to return the shares to the lender... the problem is, the stock price has gone up so much that if they have to “close their position” they’ll lose a fortune. 

- *Example: I sold 10 @ $20 = $200*

Instead of going down; the stock price went up to $400. I have to return the stock to the lender and the only way to do it is to go buy it back. So: 

- *I buy 10 @ $400 = $4,000*

- *PnL = +$200 - $4,000*

instead of making money; I lost $3,800. 

This is basically what is happening with GME on a much bigger scale

Edit 1: 

Lots of people asking about the “loan”. It’s not really a loan in the way that you’re thinking. When you execute an order to sell a share, you are required to Mark it as either “long” or “short”. What this really means is, do you “have” the stock right now in your bank account, or are you “able” to get it easily. So theoretically, everyone could be marking their orders as short sales, assuming the shares are easy to borrow and readily available, except, as the price goes up, people panic and start buying them all up and there aren’t enough to go around. This in turn drives the price up further. Hence the “squeeeeeeeze”

Typical settlement of a trade occurs t+2. In other words, you’re required to deliver the shares you sold short to the counter party within two business days of execution


Edit 2:  

for those asking about option expiration: 


An option as like a coupon. It gives the coupon holder the right to buy or sell stock, at a given price, on a given date. 

Think about it this way. If I think that the stock price of GME is going to go up in the near future, I can buy a coupon (technically a call option) that gives me the right to purchase the stock for a set price at a later date. So if GME is @ $20, I may buy a call option that gives me the right to buy GME stock for $20 per share exactly one month from now (expiration). The idea is that within that time frame; the gme stock price will increase, thereby making my coupon valuable because it allows the owner to buy at a discount. 

On the other side, you have someone who “writes” the contract. Essentially sells you the coupon. Let’s say GameStop is trading at $20, and you buy that $20 coupon. Well now, GameStop is trading at $400. So if your expiration is tomorrow you can “exercise” it, and the writer is required to deliver your shares for the agreed upon price, $20. To do that, they’ll probably have to go out and buy it at these exorbitant prices</text>

.

I own an orange factory. I want to raise money for building a new navel orange machine, so I issue orange stock. I make a special orange that you can buy for $1. I issue 1 million oranges, and raise $1 million. You now own an orange for every $1 you gave me.

That's all you get. If you're lucky, I might give you a fraction of how much I make with the new orange machine every year. But you buy the orange share because other people will want it later, when my company is big and successful, and you can try selling the orange share for more than the original dollar.

.

What is short selling?

.

You have 100 of my oranges. I come up to you Monday and say, "If you loan me those 100 oranges, I will give you $2 and your oranges back Friday. You agree, and I go off and sell your oranges for $1 each. I have $100 and owe you $2 and your oranges back. I hope your oranges will be cheaper Friday, and if they are only worth 50 cents, I buy 100 oranges and give you them and $2, and I am $48 richer.

.

What is a short squeeze?

.

Someone saw me make the deal on the oranges, and then immediately sell them. They know I have to have 100 oranges on Friday. So the go buy up all the oranges, and on Friday, when I try to buy oranges, they are standing there with a sign that says "oranges for sale $20." Anyone who wants to sell oranges is selling them there. I have to buy from them for $20 an orange. Now I have lost $1900 dollars buying the oranges back, and still owe the $2. 

.

What is stock manipulation?

.

When I buy the 100 oranges, I go around and talk about how bad oranges are. I tell my friends not to let anyone buy oranges so demand drops. I go on CNBC and talk about how I bit into a nasty orange and threw up. Now oranges are 25 cents. How wonderful... I can buy my 100 oranges for $25, and now my profits are $73!</text>

    <text>Exactly! Steam Marketplace is acting as an exchange for virtual nonsense :-D  

Stock markets are the same thing, except for part ownership of companies.  

Bonds are fancy IOUs.

Frontrunning is somebody seeing you're about to buy a dota courier for up to $5 and seeing that somebody else is already offering to sell it for $3, so they cut in line, buy it for $3.01, and sell it to you for $4.99.

99% of every industry is just learning the fancy nomenclature for simple concepts :-)</text>

    <text>Awesome write-up. One thing I've been struggling with understanding is what forces John to close his position because I didn't think shorts expired and he could hold it indefinitely? Maybe I'm wrong about them not having an expiration. Or does the lender put a date on it when they need the shares returned?</text>

    <text>Because if a Hedge Fund borrows shares they have to post collateral  which is usually cash or high quality assets (e.g. US government bonds). If the market moves in an unfavorable direction they have to post additional collateral. Since hedge funds usually don't have much cash lying around they have to sell other assets in order to have enough eligible assets for collateral.</text>

    <text>(Responding to HonorBasquiat)
Someone correct me if I’m wrong, but It all depends on the Volume or Quantity of shares a company has, I think. Stock price doesn’t equate to a company’s value until you multiply it by the number of shares it has. 

Fidelity quotes WWE’s Volume at 912,600.
And Apple stocks quotes AT&amp;T’s volume at 51,680,000. 

So again, I think share price means nothing on its own. It’s why companies can split and reverse split, to increase or decrease the number of shares, while inversely affecting the price of said share. But the total company’s value (in theory) stays the same</text>

    <text>For hedge funds and market makers, going short is quite common, but not more than 100% of company shares. Usually total short interest is in single digit percentage. You can look it up on Yahoo Finance. 

For "retail" investors it is not so common to go short as the downward risk is basically infinite and you can lose much more money than you invested.</text>

    <text>&gt; THIS IS THE GREATEST TRANSFER OF WEALTH WE ARE WITNESSING.

Nope. The greatest transfers of wealth were done through tax cuts to the rich. The US gave 3 Trillion dollars in tax cuts to the rich these past 4 years. Trillions. Some of it went into stock buybacks,  some of it fled to tax havens. Most of it is essentially hogged and is not used for the economy. 

Now a few rich folks are getting sweaty with short squeezes and that's a good thing. But for now it's a drop in the bucket until we see 1 or 2 digits extra on what we are seeing now.</text>

    <text>Shorting is very high risk, since you can incur infinite loss. So it’s always a risky, greedy gamble. With normal stocks (known as a long) you only every risk loosing whatever money you invested.

Normal people rarely ever short for this reason. It’s a high risk gamble that hedge funds do. 

Shorting over 100% of available stock is also extremely risky, because of the phenomenon called a short squeeze. Basically when all the shorters want to cash in (or if they are forced to “cover”), there is a risk that they are trying to buy all the stock at once. Demand exceeds supply -&gt; prices soar to the moon. 

This is what a few smart people in WSB noticed and decided to abuse with the GME stock. 

Specifically, you can force a squeeze by just raising the price of a stock over a certain threshold. Those that lend stock make money on interest. So they only really care that you pay the interest and that you can cover your short (have enough money to buy the stock in order to give it back). The lenders have the power to force the shorter to buy back the apple at any time if they are worried that they could not afford to do so if the price of the Apple increases. 

So WSB slowly raised the price from a few dollars to maybe 30-40$ over a few months by buying and holding the stock. At some point, this was enough to trigger some shorters to be forced to cover and massive buy orders happened, spiking the price that forced more shorters to cover etc, and causing a snowball. So the spike you see in price is not the doing of WSB, but of a short squeeze. 

Still, this high price has prompted others to short that massively high price, thinking it will eventually go down. So the market around GME is insanely volatile, with shorters forced to sell and others trying to cash in with new shorts. Meanwhile WSB is really just buying and holding.</text>

    <text>&gt; If the price went up instead, and I was wrong, I lose money when I have to buy the apple back to give back to you.

So the short person owes you an apple and 1 dollar no matter what? Like if famine decimates apple trees and apples are now worth 1,000 dollars, that person MUST give you an apple on X date and the lending fee?</text>

    <text>Something has to change now. The waves this made are huge. The stock brokers (most prominently Robinhood) heavily manipulated the market by not allowing people to buy certain stocks, which drove their price down. 

What will happen exactly isn’t clear, but my guess is that Robinhood will take the fall for this and die, other brokers will change their rules to make it easier to fuck over the retail investors in future cases like this, and the government might even slap on some more regulations on the retail market.</text>

    <text>Because people will loan you their shares to bet with, for a fee. You can borrow 100 shares through a broker by paying a fee and let's say we borrow them when they're valued at $10. If you think the value is going to go down, you sell them immediately, and now you have $1000. But you still have to give back shares you borrowed. So when it drops to $5 you buy them back for $500 and return the shares through the broker. Now you made $500, and it didn't cost you very much. These hedge funds do something like this on a MASSIVE scale.</text>

    <text>It has very little to do with the actual value of the corp, it's about the *perceived* value and perceived *future* value. If a bunch of people think the company is worth more than it is, or will be worth much more than it is, then people will buy the stocks.</text>

    <text>As I understand it ...

shorters borrow stock at 100$ agreeing to pay interest for borrowing stock they sell that stock (short) on the expectation that when they give it back to the person they lent from they will be able to buy it on market for 10$ making 90$ profit per share in this example

The problem is if the stock goes up to 1000$ the shorter has to buy the stock at 1000$ each and lost 900$ per share.

Add to this the fact that a share has no upper price cap it could be 100000000$ per share the upside risk is infinite.

Shorting is the same as buying stocks but with infinite risk.</text>

    <text>Sure thing but disclaimer, this is at the fringe of my stock knowledge so I’ll try my best. Hopefully someone will correct me if I’m wrong. 

This short selling practice is riskier than just buying and selling stocks but can have a greater reward. Basically it’s high risk, high reward. 

From my understanding, if someone thinks a stock will drop, they can sell a share owned by their broker and then buy again once it drops in price. 

They’ll get the difference in prices as profit. 

So they’re basically taking some shares owned by their broker and betting that they’ll sell high and buy low. The broker will still have the same amount of shares after it’s all said and done and the options trader will have pocketed the profits from selling high and buying low with their broker’s shares. 

Now consider the stock going up instead of down. The broker will still want to have the same number of shares after it’s all said and done so now the trader is forced to buy stocks at the higher price to cover that. They messed up and sold low and bought high. 

To my knowledge, it’s cheaper to borrow these shares from a broker than it is to actually buy them outright. So it’s cheaper to borrow a whole bunch of shares and make a big profit if the stock does as you predict. If it doesn’t then you can end up owing a bunch of money.</text>

    <text>They borrow the share from someone with the expectation that they give the share back later. They then sell the share for say $10 (meaning the hedge fund just made $10). The stock goes down to 1$ and the hedge fund buys the share back to give back to the initial person they borrowed from. The hedge fund made $9 from that deal.</text>

    <text>You borrow the stock from the company at the market price with a legally binding agreement to give it back. You also pay interest to the company based on how long you owe the share. You then immediately sell it at that price. It is then your hope that the stock falls in price so you can buy it back at the lower price and give it back to the company. Then you pocket the difference of the original sale and the new price + the interest you paid. If the price has risen when it's time to pay back the stock then you lose because you had to buy it back for more than you sold it for. Either way you have to return the stock. So the people on reddit who own GME have bought up all the stock and are now holding it, making it impossible for those who have shorted the stock to buy it back to fulfill their obligation. This causes the price of the stock to rise, potentially infinitely. And could potentially cause the hedge funds who owe the stocks back to lose, potentially infinite money.</text>

    <text>No you just owe them the share back. 

Think of it like apples. Let’s say one apples cost $1. You’re a short seller and you ask the grocery store to borrow one apple and you promise to give them an apple back next week. 

After you get the apple you turn around and sell it for $1. One week later the grocery store asks for its apple back but now they only cost $.90. So you buy one apple and give it back to the store keeping the $.10 as profit. Now imagine if the price of apples skyrocketed to $5. You would now be down $4. 

That’s essentially what these hedge funds did. They see a company like GameStop that is dying and short millions of stocks when it was at $4. As the business dies and the price goes down they pocket the difference from when they “borrowed” the stock to when they have to return it. Now they have to return the stocks they borrowed at a much higher price than they initially sold them losing billions but creating huge gains for people who are buying and holding.</text>

    <text>Basically, besides buying and selling, you can also borrow shares if you promise to give them back at a certain date. Then you take those shares, sell them for a certain price, and buy them back when the price is lower. You get to keep the difference when you give them back.</text>

How would you sell shares that you let your friend borrow?

Also the part about shorting shares that don't exist on the market isn't clear. Who are you obligated to pay back in a week on non-existent shares? It makes sense you'd have to pay back your friend after a week after borrowing their shares.</text>

    <text>Think of it this way.... say you rent a car from someone for a 4 month period at a fix rental cost of $1000. As soon as you get the car you turn around and sell it (even though this wouldn't be legal, just go with the flow) for $20k.

So.... you're taking the calculate risk that if you sell the car for say $20k, that in 4 months time you can buy the same model of car for less, ideally less + the cost of your rental feel, because you would get to pocket that extra cash.

So it's 3 months and two weeks... you're looking for the same car to buy and what do you know, you found one for $15k. So you buy the car give it back to the owner.... and you just made $4,000!!! 

This is how shorts work.... you want the value of that model of car to go down, because you can make more money the more in value it loses.

Now..... what if it's 3 month into the rental and you're looking around and you can hardly find any of those cars, as a matter of fact the car has turned into a collectors item and has increased in value, more people want to buy them which drives up the cost. As a matter of fact a subreddit started which idolizes this type of car and everyone wants to buy it. It's 3 months and 2 weeks into your rental..... and WTF the cars you can find for sale are now $360k...... You're contractually obligated to get a car back to the owner at 4 months, so weather you like it or not you have to  spend the $360k to give a car back to the owner.

This is exactly what WSB did, and why it completely bankrupted several Hedge companies that specialize in this sort of very risky business.

Hope that makes sense? The stock market is a silly place... and lots of people think the act of shorting should be illegal in the first place, because when you put in the context of a car it seems completely insane.</text>

    <text>But what's the broker's incentive to borrow stocks that they think will drop in a week? Is it just because the get commission on the sales?  

I get that they essentially borrow shares, flip them, and buy dack on the dip and return them. I don't get the why. Seems like the only one making out is the original owner.</text>

    <text>Great explanation. But can you explain why people talk about an infinite loop? its a lot of different hedge funds that shortened the stock right? Not only one entity shortened it. So one hedge fund buys the stock he needs, takes the loss, settles his contract, the stock is then sold again on the market, the next one buys it etc. until all contracts are settled?
What am i missing?</text>

    <text>So the first thing that you have to realize is that stocks are weighted different. For example, each stocks could be 0.0002% of company XYZ but be 0.009% of company ABC. 

&amp;#x200B;

To find out their actual valuation you need something called market cap: this is just the TOTAL NUMBER OF STOCKS \* PRICE FOR EACH STOCK.</text>

    <text>They do it on the assumption the price will drop.

You borrow the stock and sell it for $10.

When the price drops you buy it for less.

The difference in price is your profit minus interest.</text>

The “somehow” is doing a lot of heavy work here. Why is this even possible in the first place? Shouldn't there be a system that automatically rejects requests like this? Maybe a pop up message like,

*I'm sorry, your request is invalid. You cannot borrow 1.5 million shares. Only 1 million shares are available.*</text>

    <text>It happens behind the scenes and most people are not aware of it. Your broker handles that. It's part of your account agreement (specifically the margin agreement).

You may, but probably won't, get any interest payments for doing so.</text>

    <text>&gt;Total BS answer above. Hedge funds are out billions, and those billions are going precisely to Wall Street Bets, many of whom are not wealthy.   

First off, if you think that other hedge funds haven't jumped on this train then you're sorely mistaken. They're all in a position to capitalize on this event.   

Secondly, most people are extremely bad at investing because humans by nature are emotional and irrational. There's a reason why more than 80% of all active fund managers consistently fail to beat the overall market. Because humans are bad at it.   

Sure, some people on WSB will make money. Some will make A LOT of money. But most will end up losing money like always happens whenever people try and beat the market or try and jump on a train that has long left the station.     

You shouldn't mistake some hedge funds getting screwed in the ass for something it's not: rich people will still get richer, like they always do.</text>

    <text>Shorting is technically not illegal and helps the market to be efficient by eliminating failing companies faster. Although a lot of people don't like it because shorters have incentive to push companies to fail even if they wouldn't have failed normally. 

Naked shorting is illegal and seems to be what's happened with GameStop stocks because the short position was something like 140% of available shares.</text>

    <text>There's an argument that short sellers keep the market honest. If you're cooking the books to overvalue your company to boost stock prices to get a bonus, then a short seller can call BS and go public with evidence of cooked books, causing your stock price to fall. This is, in effect, giving them a financial incentive to discover which companies are overvalued and to correct that.

I'm not sure I buy it as a necessity, but the argument is sound.</text>

    <text>Options started when farmers needed money to plant their crops and didn’t like rates and terms offered by banks. So they offer investors the chance buy corn (the underlying) at a set price in the future (the expiry) if the market price for corn (the underlying) is above a certain value (the call). 

Then some wanted the other direction if the notice was under a value (the put). 

Then someone wanted call/put to limit their maximum losses for the corn they bought “normally”. (Stop loss ). But some just wanted to sell the insurance (naked shorting). 

Then someone said “let’s make options for everything”.

    <text>Yea the hope is that its worth less, so that you have profited off the difference,  but your act of shorting it shouldn't have actually *caused* it to lose value. 

The original stock holder isn't really affected, because the stock would have dipped in value during that same time anyway.  They are a long term holder, hopefully seeing the value of that stock rise over a long period, but pretty much all stock rise and dip within short time periods. So the short seller is cashing in on that short term dip. No one is getting screwed.</text>

    <text>It’s controversial but here is a legitimate argument for the “pro” allowing short selling side. If money is tied only to stocks going up (I.e. normal long positions, the opposite of short selling) then as a CEO of a company I only have a motivation to bullshit about the health and future prospects of the company. No one has a real incentive to critically examine what I say.

On the other hand if short selling exists now people have a financial incentive to actually evaluate what someone is saying, and a way of putting their money where their mouth is. Enron, for example, had its problems uncovered by short sellers doing a higher level of diligence understanding the companies finances. Without short selling, there are arguments that this type of thing may not be uncovered.</text>

    <text>Shorting isn’t necessary for the economy. It’s been made illegal in various countries to no ill effect. In the US, it was (at least partially) banned for several decades after the 1929 stock market crash. I think 2007 is the last time more ways to short stock was made legal.

The ostensible upside is that more information is better when determining a price. For instance, Tesla has a lot of people shorting the stock because it seems a little silly that it would have a market value more than other car companies that sell way more cars. That might be a sign Tesla is overvalued or dependent on Elon Musk’s celebrity status. (Tesla also has a lot going for it. Not saying the haters are right. New tech is always risky so they could be but they could be totally wrong. But knowing Tesla has as many doubters as fans should factor in any investor’s personal decision on whether to own part of Tesla.)

Basically, shorting is like the number of thumbs down on a YouTube video. Is it necessary? No. Is it dickish? Yes. Is it information? Also yes.</text>

    <text>&gt; Why is the "shorting" of a company necessary

It is another way to manage risk, which helps keep the whole stock market a little more stable.

&gt; or even legal? 

Because there's no law against it.

&gt; Wouldn't the top elitists just manipulate the market and cause the failing company to get smashed into oblivion, ergo gaining more money from it?

Deliberately manipulating the stock market is *super* illegal. For example, Elon Musk made a "joke" about selling SpaceX[?] stock for $420 and it caused a huge swing in that stock's price, and the Federal Trade Commission threatened to fine him and force him to give up control over the company.

Does it still happen? Probably. It *is* illegal, though.

&gt; How is this beneficial for anyone but the top investors?

It's not, really. But that's not really relevant. Privately traded stock is only beneficial for top investors. The stock market in general favors people with tons of money: you can invest in many different stocks so your risk is minimized (if one stock fails, you don't lose all of your money, just that one investment); and, if you buy $20 worth of shares and they all double in price, you make $20, woo (and that's already kind of an unrealistic increase most of the time). If you buy $2 million worth of those same shares and they double in price...

&gt; Is the system rigged?

Depends on what you mean. In general, yes, because being poor is expensive but when you have enough money people will just start handing you more of it just because. The stock market naturally favors people with enough money to throw around, but that's just how money works, it's not necessarily by design. It's also complicated and messy, which makes getting involved with it also complicated and messy, which is too much of a barrier for a lot of people which limits how much you can realistically expect to make.</text>

    <text>Oh, I should mention, it's a two sided market. It's not just fancy sellers and poor buyers or something. If we go back to my example, if a seller says they want to sell for $30, but there's a bunch of other sellers selling for $20, then no one will buy from me.

So the sellers are competing with each other to get people to buy from them, and the buyers are competing to get people to sell to them instead of someone else willing to pay more.

When there's a lot more people selling than buying, the seller completion will drive the price down, since the buyers have many options to pick low prices, and the sellers would rather $15 than $0 if they can't find a buyer.

But if it's flipped, and buyers are competing to find a seller, then the price goes up instead, for basically the same reason.</text>

    <text>Short selling is a somewhat controversial topic. There is an argument that it allows for proper price discovery and more people making more trades helps make markets more efficient. Knowing that there are people who are actively betting that a company share price is going to fall is just as valuable as knowing there are people who are betting that it goes up.

The flip side of that argument is as your say - short selling is used by people to distort the market.</text>

    <text>Index tracking funds, for example, are forced to hold shares in their index i.e. GME is part of an index similar to the S&amp;P500. These funds can then lend out the shares and gain some profit from the interest earned</text>

    <text>Yeah, essentially arbitrary. But fundamentals do guide the price expectations of both buyers and sellers. GME situation rn is a bit of an outlier because of how ridiculously shorted it was. Short interest is 140% of outstanding shares which has unnaturally skewed the supply-demand scenario. It's a seller's market for that stock.</text>

    <text>Even if the financial outlooks of a company are not looking good and you think the stock is likely to go down, there's always a possibility of something happening to make the price go up again, for example, a change in management (like with GME), new business opportunities (like for BB), the possibility of getting enough money to get through difficult times (AMC) or even getting bought out by the competition.

A stock is never truly "doomed", it's just more or less likely to rise in price again in a certain time frame. There's really no way to know if a stock is truly going down, you can only make more or less accurate educated guesses.</text>

    <text>A **stock** is like a piece of company. You can see how good they are, what the profits are, how risky it is, and say "I want to own some of it - split (already made) costs, share future profits"... So you get a stock. The price of the stock in an ideal market reflects how much profit you estimate it makes.

In a **real market**, a single company has only so many stocks - think number of left backs and quality of left backs. So **supply and demand** plays a big role in determining price. There's also people in the market that will hold out on their pick and refuse to sell them cos they "like the underdog" or for other more human, less profit driven reasons. And if the only left back that Pep wants is Cancelo, then you can hold out for 60m£ and that's that, regardless of how much he's actually worth.

And like sport, there's **side betting** - "I bet this guy wins the Champions League" or "gets sold for less than 5m". So bets can be binary or based off how far from an arbitrary threshold you are. And bets can have odds (prices reflect that). The good thing about a bet is you don't need a share in a football club to profit off an opinion. You can put far lesser money... Or leverage - "Every million above 5m, I get you 100 beers. Vice versa for below 5m". And just like the beers, some bets have limited upside, lots of downside. called **derivatives** - cos they derive from the share price but don't need a share. Others involve a handshake to go "I'll get a share from you for this price, and sell back to you at market value in six months, and since you think Arsenal is on the decline it will be cheaper then and you'll make a profit". Called a put option (or a **short**)

Funds - like hedge funds - use these trading and betting strategies to make money. This has been a growing component in the market - right now there are companies that if they lose a big bet, can drastically affect the market - like a mafioso betting on Pogba transfers with a billion dollars. Trading will be suspended sometimes.

In the news recently, a hedge fund punched in numbers on a stock (happens to be GameStop) - and pledged to short - i.e  sell X stocks they didn't have and buy back later to return to settle sale - hoping to drive down price. The problem was X was 140% the number of total stocks for that company. People in /r/wallstreetbets noticed that. And bought up some stocks - to hold out like Cancelo. They knew the hedge fund would need to buy in the next few days. And they knew it needed every last stock. So they spread the word, and the price went up as more people bought it. And the hedge fund's bet went really bad. This is a **short squeeze**. You know the hedge fund has this short position, that they're desperate for the Cancelo, so you hold out for 50m (price increase).

There's a lot more nastiness, politics, slander behind the scenes, but strip them away, and this is just a bad bet, and people who took advantage of that mistake. And it happens every day.

    <text>How can 150% of a company's shares be shorted at once? How can MORE STOCKS THAT EXIST be shorted at the same time? And does it have something to do with "[naked short selling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_short_selling)" and 'ghost stocks'? Or is it just the same stocks being shorted multiple times? What does that look like in practice?</text>

    <text>I have a more basic question on the share-trading side of things. I was reading through u/deepfuckingvalue 's post history trying to understand how this all started. Can someone explain to me the 'options' that he has been buying for the last \~18 months? Are these just other random people's shares who want to sell them? Or is he buying the on-loan shares of the short-sellers directly? Or something else? Or a combination of these?

I understand he started early on a big bet basically, was that because it was was back in 2019 that the shorting started? Before the pandemic? Or did he just get lucky? And then as the pandemic hit and the shorting started, he kept increasing his position?

Also can someone explain the timeline of when WSB got involved in a big way and the shit really hit the fan for these Hedge Funds?</text>

    <text>401k's are generally run by very, very safe investors.  Even the higher growth 401k's aren't all that risky investors.  Melvin and Citron are extreme risk Hedge Funds as in they invest in high risk, huge profit scams like what they're trying to do to Game Stock by shorting 140% of the total stock out there.

It is highly doubtful that your 401k has touched either Hedge fund with a 10 foot pole and if they did it's in some extremely small percentage of the 401k's total amount invested.

That being said, because Melvina and Citron are probably invested throughout the market, when they are forced into bankruptcy and/or sell all their stock to make up for their losses on Game Stop, it will affect the overall market to some small amount.  Your 401k may slightly dip for a bit as stocks correct.  At worst they're saying it will deflate the tech bubble we're in sort of like 2000.  Yes it will affect the stock market.  No it won't be that bad.</text>

    <text>I have a question. Before this r/wallstreetbets story broke, I was seriously considering trading for the first time. The dollar cost averaging strategy with a mutual fund seemed appealing. 

Some people think that the rules of Wall Street are going to change as a result of the current situation. So, my question is, is now the wrong time to begin that kind of strategy or is that area of the market likely going to remain unscathed?</text>

They collect money from various investors and through the power of this massive amount of money, bet on the market which has the side effect of changing the market. How is one considered manupulation and the other fair business practice?</text>

    <text>They have to pay back the stock at a certain date. Think about it like this: I “borrow” a car from you that is worth 10k. I’m pretty sure the car will drop down to 7k in a month. So I sell the car right now for 10k. At the end of the month, I buy the car for 7k and give it back to you. I just made a 3k profit.

But of course, this is a risk. Because I might be wrong and mid-month, the car is now 30k not 7k like I predicted so I have a pretty big loss. This thing could in theory go to infinite losses</text>

    <text>The price is more an indicator of what the price was the last time stock was bought/sold. So in your example somebody bought a share at 20 that means somebody posted their share for sale for 20 and thus when the transaction went through everybody can see “hey I guess this stock trades for 20 a share”. Then somebody else who owns a share can see “there sure are a lot of people trying to buy shares at 20 a pop, let me see if somebody will pay 20.05” so they put in a sell order for their share at 20.05. Somebody can agree to buy this (thinking it’ll keep going up in the future right) and so they place the order and the transaction goes through. Now everybody can see that the last traded price was 20.05.

This is a very minimal example however it’s essentially how it works. When lots of people and lots of stock are involved it can appear as if it’s constantly moving around like a liquid however it’s still comprised of individual transactions.</text>

    <text>Robinhood is an app that lets you trade stock. They're owned by a large financial company called Citadel. Recently, Citadel bet against GameStop stock (where if that stock loses value, Citadel makes money). However, r/wallstreetbets collectively bought GameStop stock, raising its price and causing Citadel to lose billlions.

Citadel then forced Robinhood to halt the trading of GameStop stock so that more people couldn't buy it. This is blatant market manipulation and illegal and resulted in massive backlash across Reddit and the political spectrum.</text>

As to your second question, once people start selling the price will fall like a brick. The first few that sell will be lucky and make money, after that it will be a race to the bottom. That's why everyone is WSB keep saying things like "hold the line". Basically begging people not to sell. The price will stay inflated as long as people don't sell, and hedge funds that shorted will keep losing money, but eventually the price will crash.</text>

    <text>Robinhood is a stock market trading app. Yesterday morning around 11et, the app stopped our ability to BUY GameStop, blackberry, amc and several other stocks. In doing so, SOME people panicked and sold and this allowed hedge finders a chance to get their hands on a number of those shares. They were the able to sell and repurchase those same shares in an attempt to drive the price back down drastically, manipulating the actual value of each share. We held the fucking line though and majority of us didn’t give in to the tricks. We held our shares.</text>

    <text>This is a really high level answer, but in this world there are two types of economies - command economies and market economies. A command economy is what you're describing, where there is a central entity that calculates what the price is going to be. While it's kind of up for debate, these economies don't do to well (examples are North Korea and Venezuela.)

A market economy is one in which people can buy and sell at any price, and the price is just whatever people are willing to transact at for now. In this case there were people selling at $20 when you bought it, but it's sold out when the next buyer gets there, and the next cheapest price someone's willing to sell at is $20.05. If there was someone selling at $21 then the next buyer would have to buy at $21 instead.</text>

    <text>They buy the 50 that are for sale and then return them. This drives the price up because the 50 that are for sale will be for increasing prices. the 1st one might be $200 then the 2nd one might be $210 etc etc until maybe the 50th is $500 let's say. Mr short returns all those shares to person they borrowed them from but they still owe 100 shares and nobody is selling, plus they're getting margin called and are being forced to buy any available share at any price. How do you get someone to sell something they don't want to sell? you offer them increasingly more money for it until they change their mind. So now someone sells them the 51st share for $2000 and someone else sells them their 52nd share for $3000 etc. Well, now the person who they returned the borrowed shares to might decide that they'll part ways with them, but only for $15,000 each. So Mr short bought the same share, the first time for $200 and then again for $15,000.

That's the idea behind a "short squeeze". The short positions are forced to buy so the demand is extremely high and eventually the supply will respond, but it won't be cheap.</text>

    <text>As of the market close today Class A shares of Berkshire Hathaway are valued at $348,220.00 USD per share. So yeah, stocks can easily get to or above $5k USD. 

The GameStop situation is kinda complicated, but in short the share price is going up because of all the demand/interest in buying shares. Once people start to sell, the available supply of shares goes up and the price starts going down (typically). Whoever starts selling first will potentially make the most but it depends on what they paid for their shares in the first place. Buy at $10/share 3 weeks ago and sell at $400 today, you're sitting pretty. Buy at $399/share yesterday and sell at $400 today, go hit the Dollar Menu. 

Whoever waits 'too long' won't make any profit or could lose money depending on how much they paid for their shares vs what they can sell for at that moment. A lot of people will probably 'lose' money because they are more concerned with making life miserable for all these hedge funds and other Wall Street traders. Even then, the question is 'Are they losing more than they put in to begin with?' Or are they 'losing' the potential profit if they sell tomorrow morning vs selling next Friday.</text>

    <text>Don't really have the time to give a proper answer to you. But I want to say, from the advice you'll be given, do learn from multiple sources. A lot of stock advice and "education" is quite bad and you won't really be able to spot what's incorrect until you've heard things from many sources.

Also to get better answers, you may want to edit in how you best like to learn. Books, videos, podcasts?</text>

    <text>The next buyer does not have to buy at any specific increment above the last price. If you buy at $20.00 I can buy at $20.01 if I wanted and someone was willing to sell me a share at that price. The price changes based on what people are willing to pay for 1 share. For instance I think company A is doing not so well so I think their shares are worth $50 I set a buy for $50. However everyone else thinks company A is doing REALLY well so they set their buys at $60, the price of the shares are $60 because that's what people are willing to pay for 1 share.</text>

    <text>I'm not particularly knowledgeable on this, but AFAIK it's not a safe assumption, because many of the folks who shorted are still holding out hoping that it goes down. Once they start buying back, the price will keep rising and scare the other big money gamblers into buying too. I've heard this called a "squeeze" by other redditors who know more than me. This is exacerbated by the fact that hedge fund managers etc. might be pressured by their investors to chicken out since they don't want to lose any more than the fortune they've already lost.</text>

    <text>It can theoretically go to $5000 if the WSB thesis is correct and this whole thing ends with the hedge funds buying back the shares because they can't afford to keep losing money. I'm not trying to predict what will happen, but it's technically plausible. This hasn't happened yet, the highly-upvoted post on WSB about being 30 seconds away is wrong. 

If WSB is right, and barring any outside interference by Brokers or Regulators, topping out will be indicated by total short interest coming down from 140% or 250% or whatever it is, back to more realistic levels. When this happens, large investors who have been sitting out this circus are going to see the opportunity behind an obvious incoming crash in the price, and are going to open new short positions. This is going to cause the price of the stock to crash faster than it ever rose. Any retail investor that buys in near the top is going to lose most of their investment. I'm not going to try to predict when the top will be, but be careful as the price continues to rise - you don't want to be the last person who bought in at the top.</text>

    <text>If you're asking "is it possible for any stock to get to $5000?" then yes of course. Check out ticker BRK.A

The thing about the price of a stock is... it's a meaningless number by itself. If I told you I have a company XYZ and the stock price is $35 is that good or bad? You have no idea.

You need the full picture, the main part being: number of total shares. If my company's stock is $35 and the total shares are 100 that means my company is valued at 35 * 100 = $3,500. But if my company instead has 50 million shares at $35 then the valuation of the company is $1.75 billion.</text>

    <text>There's probably a long and technical answer as to how the value of stocks are generally set, but the ELI5 answer is that it's worth what people are willing to pay for it. If there was nobody willing to purchase a stock for a price above $10, than that stock is worth $10. The changes in price are essentially just transactions happening, and the price of the stock that you see on the ticker is just the most recent sale of the stock.</text>

    <text>Easy way to think about it...

You have 100 shares of company G stock that currently sells at $100.  Your friend thinks the price will drop to $50 in one week, so he borrows your 100 shares with the contractual guarantee to return the shares back to you in a week.

He immediately sells those shares for $100.  Now neither of you own those shares. But your friend still owes you the shares, so he’ll just buy it back from the market in a week when it drops to $50, return the shares to you and pocket a $5000 profit.

Only, the stock price doesn’t drop, it goes up.  To $200.  Your friend owes you 100 shares of stock, so he has to buy it from the market for $200.  He return the stocks to you and has lost $10000.  

Now bump the numbers up.  Assume there are 1 million shares of the stock available, so he makes agreements to borrow all 1 million from the owners, yet somehow also manage to borrow about 500,000 shares that simply don’t exist.  But since it’s a contract to borrow shares, it doesn’t matter...they’re just paper shares, and he’ll make a fortune when the stock drops.  Except the share price doesn’t drop, and he owes people 1.5 million shares, but there are only 1 million shares on the entire market.  So not only does he need to buy 1m shares at the new inflated price, he’s also got to somehow but 500,000 shares that are nonexistent.  So in order to pay back those borrowed shares, he needs to buy them back from other owners, who are more than happy to sell them back to him at an even higher price than the day before.  In short, the attempt to buy back all those shares that he owes but that don’t exist only pushes the price of the stock higher and higher and the losses just keep growing and growing.

If Melvin hadn’t gotten greedy and dumb and bought sell options that exceeded the number of shares in the market, they might have taken a big loss, but now they’re caught in a self-inflicted feedback loop where their losses only keep growing more and more as they try to fill their obligation to pay back all the shares that they owe.

This is why derivatives (assets “derived” from the value of actual assets) can be such dangerous bets...they basically were created to hedge risk, but Wall Street traders tend to just treat it like gambling.  And...they not only gamble with the money, they borrow tons of it issuing the investment as collateral...and gamble with that.  They think it’s an easy bet, so borrowing isn’t a big deal...unless they miscalculate the risk, which is how it can all blow up in their face.  Which is exactly what happened in 2008.  They had $100, decided to bet it all on black at roulette...but though the chance of red coming up was &lt;1% so they borrowed another $9,900
 to put on black.  A dumb bet because they didn’t properly determine the risk of the bet.</text>

    <text>That company is called Citadel. They don't own Robinhood, but they make money off of the order flow that they receive from Robinhood. That means that as you and I buy and sell stock, Robinhood passes these orders on to Citadel to handle.

Citadel is owned by a guy named Ken Griffin. He is one of the people who helped bail out Melvin today. Melvin is the fund that lost their ass by shorting Gamestop.

Seems to me that Robinhood restricted trades on stocks to make Citadel happy. Sure, Citadel loses a little money off of the reduced order flow from Robinhood, but it is more costly to them to have to bail out their buddies.</text>

    <text>That is exactly what has been happening.  People who shorted it at ~$20 closed out, and then new people shorted it because it is so high.  So even though some shorts have been closing out their positions the short interest is still over 100%.</text>

    <text>Do you mean can *this* stock go to $5k? Yes, it could. As far as “can any stock go to $5k”.... it’s all absolutely arbitrary (sparing nuance). $GME could theoretically be priced at 10x what it is this instant, with 1/10th the number of shares, and the market capitalization would be identical.

The other comment about Berkshire... they have “class A” at ~$350,000 a share, and “class B” at $230 a share. If you buy $350,000 worth of class B it is practically the same as a single class A. Disclaimer for anyone who actually knows about stocks: “practically the same” is not actually true as there are key differences (e.g. class A is guaranteed not to split) but is great for the purposes of this illustration.</text>

    <text>Also, the interest they have to pay is proportional to the price of the stock. So if the stock goes up 1000% they have to pay 10x the original interest on the same short that was purchases at 1/10th the price.</text>

    <text>Stocks can reach $5k - Berkshire Hathaway stock for example sells for $348,000 each today.

A "top out" is just when the majority of transactions on a stock shift from buys to sells, but there's no ceiling technically.

If you stay away from options trading (buying calls and puts),  diversify your investments, and don't "day trade" it is very hard to lose everything.</text>

    <text>And it seems as was pointed out above that shorting the stock is much more riskier than just buying a stock and hoping that you don’t lose money. When you buy stock, like was pointed out earlier, you can only lose the value of that stock. When you short you’re in to the commission upfront to the lender, and you have to provide the shares back to the lender in the end no matter what their cost. If they don’t go below the price for which you borrowed them, then you lose money.
   Another point about shorting stocks is that when it occurs there is another data point provided about the value of that stock. The more data points you have that come out too high, and also to low, gives you a fix on what the actual value should be.</text>

    <text>GameStop was expected to lose value, so large investing firms borrowed a LOT of shares (more than actually exist) and sold them for the price at that time.

They have to buy them back which they were okay when the price was expected to drop.

People realized they were dependent on the price dropping and bought a lot of GameStop shares to create a demand for the stock to raise the price.

This means the big firms have to pay the larger price when they have to return the borrowed stock.

Which means they have to buy the stocks back that all of those people have bought and have now risen in price a lot.

People are expecting the price to rise A LOT more when the big firms start buying it up to "close their position", aka returning the borrowed stocks.

This isn't financial advice, just an explanation.</text>

    <text>There was someone willing to sell a share at $20, but they sold all the shares they were willing to sell at that price.

The next cheapest someone is willing to sell is at $20.05. That becomes the "ask" price after the $20 shares are purchased.

Prices go up and down because that is the price people are willing to both sell and buy at, but there are limited quantities of shares available at any given price at a given time.</text>

    <text>Theoretically, stocks can go as high as the moon 🚀.

Stock prices move in supply (sellers) and demand (buyers). If there's a high demand with limited supply, stock price goes up. If there's not much demand with a lot of supply, stock prices goes down.

The thing about the stock market is that there is always a "market" where people want to buy and others want to sell. You may not get the price you want, but there's always someone. There's people that think $5k is the top and sell, and there's another that think there's more profit to be made greater than $5k so they buy. So you can't really "top out"; if any, it usually just fluctuates around $5k.</text>

    <text>Yes, but keep in mind that "safely investing" is very different from "getting in on anything that's happening". There's always something happening, but most of the time you will find out what that is only after you are in a position to benefit from it.  

Most investors don't exceed market returns, and if they do so it's for a short time (a year or so). As a result, the easiest and lowest-effort way to beat most investors is to buy the market, e.g. purchase an index fund that mimics a broad market index such as the S&amp;P500. Apple or Tesla do better than that index this year and maybe next year, and even the year after that. But not every year. Here is a list of the best performing stock for each year since 2000 (and how they were doing in 2019 or whenever this article was published): https://www.workandmoney.com/s/best-performing-stocks-by-year-5f67b9eba7a64ce3. I am guessing that you have probably only ever heard of 5 or 6 of these companies. How many of them do you think you would have been able to pick to buy? Much easier to buy the market and not tie yourself in knots trying to figure out which companies are going to do better than the market. Because most companies do worse than the market.  

Ran across this article while looking for the number of stocks that outperform the market over time. It's a pretty small number. Some good information in this interview.

    <text>Yes, you could go bankrupt and yes that’s realistically possible—Melvin Capital recently got money from a larger hedge fund specifically for this reason.

The borrowing contracts are secured by “margin” accounts.  Brokers require you to deposit cash, equal to 25% of the dollar amount you shorted.</text>

    <text>There is some magical thinking going around these threads, and I question the honesty of it because convincing other people to hold "for the rest of their lives" will propel the price higher(so you can make off with a bigger pay-day, perhaps?)

At some point the vast majority of people will start selling, the shorts will be covered, and the poor zealots who bought into the "hold til zero" rhetoric will be left holding the bag.

I don't want people to lose their life savings over this. No one will be there to help the little guy who bought at 500 when the stock drops back down to 20.</text>

    <text>Demand and supply.  
Remember the toilet paper craze?  
More people (e.g. 6 people) want to buy at $10, but only 5 people selling at $10, other sell at $11.

1 person has to buy at $11. Bam. Price go up.

Price is the last stock price matched.</text>

For people that don’t understand **shorting**; here is my best explanation at it (this is heavily inspired by a YouTube video)…

**Shorting is when you think a company is going to do badly so you borrow that company stock from a broker and promise to pay them back later.**

Here is a Non-Stock Example:

Imagine that you thought **apples were going to go down in value** and they currently cost **$1.**

You go to a shop keeper and ask if you can borrow an apple which you will give back later.

You borrow the apple from him and sell it someone for $1 and then wait for the price to change. If the price goes down to 50 cents then you can buy 2 apples for a dollar. You go back to the shopkeeper and give him back the apple.

**He has an apple back and you have an extra 50 cents.**

**In stock market terms you have shorted them apples**. Now replace the apples with stocks and you hopefully get the idea.

2 other things worth mentioning about short positions f**irst you have to pay an interest rate** **on your short positions** because you're borrowing something.

Secondly, **short positions can be greater than 100% of stock.**

**Let’s get to GME**

GME is a brick and mortar video game company, after Covid hit Gamestop **unsurprisingly** has a couple of bad months and revenue falls. GME falls to about $4 per share.

Largely because of this many **big international investors essentially thought Gamestop was going to go bust and therefore shorted GME.**

Hoping to see it collapse, they didn’t see that there was some good news coming Gamestop’s way.

Firstly in **Mid August our saviour Ryan Cohen started buying GME shares.** By December Cohens company had bought about 9 million share (13% GME).

Then in January Cohen and some other CEOs were appointed to Gamestop’s board.

This gave Gamestop a huge advantage as **now they’ve got a billionaire investor who’s experienced with running ecommerce companies** which is exactly the business model Gamestop needs to shift to.

Secondly in **November PS5 and Xbox series X was released starting a new console cycle** which is good news for Gamestop.

Thirdly Gamestop **signed a deal with Microsoft which gave them a share of all of Xbox’s digital revenues**

So, what happened to the stock?

Firstly, the institutions that were shorting GME bought more short positions to try to supress the stock price.

This chart shows that for example on January 11th **there are massive 4 million short positions** taken despite the fact that this was the day Cohens board appointments were announced.

📷

In total 71 million short positions were taken even though Gamestop only had a float of 69.75 million shares. Remember you can have more short positions that actual shares.

This gets crazier because about 20% of Gamestop shares is held by insiders like Cohen. Insiders can’t sell easily because of regulations.

📷

There is the same amount again owned by big institutions who don’t normally trade either.

📷

**So that leaves between 20 to 30 million actively traded stocks and 71 million short positions who all need to buy stock**

That is a lot of demand and not much supply. Wallstreet Bets realized this and determined that if they bought the stock and **held** they could force the price up which triggers a **short squeeze.**

Where people with short positions desperately buy into a stock and try to cover before the price gets too high. These people are losing money but covering now prevents them from bigger losses.

**However because there isn’t enough stocks to go around the price of each stock jumps spectacularly**.

Remember it costs money to shorter position forever because of interest **so they want to act fast** which is exactly what happened to Volkswagen in 2008. Where it breifly became the most expensive stock in history. **Which is exactly what is happening with GME right now!**

📷

Ulitmatly Redditors made big money and **if you hold for longer you will make more.**

The 2 big short sellers who lost big money is **Melvin Capital and Citeron Resarch.**

**You can tell that they are panicking because 2 days ago Melvin Capital had to be bailed out by 2 big insitutions which isnt good for them.**

**There is a lot of short postions to be covered if you hold for longer the price for each stock will increase.**

Secondly if you've seen anything about this in the news it's often spun as mental reddit investors ruin the market **there's three things worth saying here**:

Firstly, wall street bets doesn't actually **hold much sway over the market itself as WSB is an internet forum not an institution**.

Secondly, it's not as if the market was rational **beforehand it's just that only hedge funds used to be able to manipulate** it and this wasn't even clear manipulation obviously some of GME's rise is a function of speculation but there's a good argument that it was undervalued and over shorted to begin with.

Thirdly it's fundamentally a good thing that people are able to get into the stock market and make **money off GME as it might make things more volatile and harder for hedge funds.**

But fuck Wall Street.

tl;dr: Melvin Capital and other big short shellers were caught with their dick in the cookie jar when they overshorted GME making GME shares go to the fucking moon. If you hold GME you could be able to go to fucking Alpha Centuri and bankrupt big short shellers</text>

    <text>Value investing is possible in any market and there are definitely still undervalued stocks, but they're always far less interesting and won't net you 10x returns in a year like you might want. I started out just putting a few bucks into companies that you personally like to start out (if you like Xbox you can go MSFT, if you like iPhones you can go AAPL, etc.)

They made billions of losses but some of the hedge funds propably recovered yesterday.
Still many of them are in, if we don't see anymore illegal actions we will be bathing in their money, they will go bankrupt.

    <text>&gt;	 2) most of the time the owners won't even know their share is gone. A broker like Robinhood holds people's share in their accounts, and can lend them out to others without you even knowing.

So this is like me having money in a bank, and they use that money for loans other bank customers take out, or other investments? It’s really all constantly moving around behind the scenes. Not that my money is gone, but if I withdraw it just comes from a pool, not like I have my own untouched “bucket” if you will.</text>

    <text>Generally you borrow from a market maker (big mofos that provide liquidity, aka keep the money and shares flowing between parties). Market makers assume this risk. Now no one really explicitly borrows your shares. The market makers can lend but they are legally yours. Generally they cover this when you buy shares on margin (you borrow from them to buy shares, they lend to others, and they collect interest from both sides).

If you own shares and aren't using margin, there's no risk of losing your shares. If you're on margin, you have all sorts of risks. Since the market maker is taking a risk lending, they can liquidate your shares of the stock goes down too much, they can change the margin requirements (how much collateral you need to have to maintain the position) if the stock is really volatile, etc. They can just decide at any time really to not let you borrow any more.</text>

    <text>You're thinking of this wrong. The market is not a person making up prices, it's a book with many orders on it. Like an auction with 1000 of the same item.

So when you buy for $20, it's because someone else had an offer to sell for $20. But now that order is filled, that stock is transfered, and they're off the books. So the next person who wants to buy has to buy from someone who's selling for more money, since the $20 unit was already snapped up. So maybe that person is selling for $20.05, or maybe it's $30 if there aren't a lot of people selling today.

The "price" is basically an average of the prices people are willing to buy at right now, and the prices people are willing to sell at right now. But no one necessarily pays that price, since it's just matching people.</text>

    <text>Correct. Short sellers pay a daily fee on borrowed shares. The fee is variable based on the stock's daily closing price. As the stock price shoots up, so does the fee. That's why there's pressure on shorts to close their positions rather than just riding it out.</text>

    <text>It's like a game of hot potato. If, for example, Melvin Capital become insolvent, the court can decide that their parent company Buttonwood Plot LLC is liable for their debts. If they cannot pay, it goes all the way down to the banks.

Regardless, the theory is that it *cannot* be weaselled out of.  I say theory because theoretically in the world of finance lots of stuff that cannot be done is done all the time. Hell, you theoretically can't short imaginary shares but Melvin did (140%). So lots of stuff can be weaselled out of, as we saw in 2008. 

Basically, no, if the individual hedge funds become insolvent, the buck just gets passed down the line. This is why people are so afraid - CEOs of retail trading platforms were on the news last night outright stating that they limited trading because they are worried about their brokers, and their own, liquidity.</text>

    <text>GameStop has two strikes against it right?  They not a profitable company and short sellers have a vested interested in seeing them fail.  I am curious as to what will happen to the people on reddit who sunk a lot of their hard-earned and saved money when the company fails, as it seems it eventually must.  With people continuing to buy at this inflated price don’t they need to get out ASAP to avoid losing “bigly” as it were?  I’m totally up for seeing hedge fund billionaires take a drubbing, but isn’t the likelihood of small investors losing everything great as well?  I don’t know Jack shit about investing, but this whole thing feels a lot like the Boston Bomber debacle.  Are the Internet chortles worth it?  Is it likely that only the short sellers will lose on this?  This seems like a bad time to play with retirement money.  OTOH, if it is only short sellers who stand to get fucked, let the fucking be epic.</text>

    <text>Theoretically a stock and get to any number, but usually it is somewhat predictable.  And yes some people are not going to sell in time and likely lose a lot of money in all of this.  How much they lose depends on where they bought in but naturally some people are going to buy closer to the peak and those people are most at risk</text>

    <text>What's stopping Elon is that if HE were to do that, it would legally count as stock market manipulation - which is extremely illegal.

    <text>As part of borrowing the stock from me, they have to put up collateral. If the price of rebuying the stock goes up, I can make them put up more collateral. If it gets too high, I might force them to buy it back at the current price. Or I might take all their collateral and use that to buy myself a share.</text>

    <text>I don't think this is true. They can extend their short positions to delay buying the stocks. This of course costs the fund more money. So they are trying to delay buying the stock until the price goes down. This has caused the standoff between the shorts and the shareholders.

Shareholders can hold shares forever at no cost. Shorters incur more costs the longer they delay buying the stock. But there is not a firm deadline that shorters must legally buy, which is misinformation I have seen going around.</text>

    <text>The way I think about it is, if you have some money to burn just to want to participate in this historical hedge fund ass fucking, then do it for the lols. Don't buy in thinking you are going to pay for your mortgage. Do it for the solidarity. Some of us common people might make a lot of money off you helping in a small way to keep the prices up during the squeeze but I will rather these people make money that actually will be put to some good use over hedge funders fucking with the market.</text>

    <text>&gt;In theory the people that lent them the GME shares would call in all their collateral before it ever got to a “bankruptcy” situation.

But, if this squeeze really does happen and send the price to the moon, how would they possibly pay it all off? If they go bankrupt who buys the stock?</text>

    <text>There is a limited supply of stocks on the market at a given time, and typically a corporation will also hold it's own stock to pay CEO's and board members, Should they execute stock options, but corporations with their board approval can issue new stock. The board is a representation of the shareholder, and in many companies are elected by shareholders, so issuing new stocks, and diluting the pool of stocks available on the market is usually avoided. Board members prefer to issue bonds, or sell their debt to the market. However in the case of bankruptcy, or liquidation of the corporate structure, the bond holders are entitled to redemption first.</text>

    <text>401k accounts and brokerage accounts have different tax laws. 401k in the simplest terms tax you less if you wait until you are 59 I believe before you take money out. In a brokerage account you are taxed "capitol gains" tax for whatever you remove from the account that is profit. So if you out in 10k and it goes up to 20k and you take the 20k out, you get taxed "capitol gains" tax on the 10k you made but not the 10k you put in. 401k you get taxed heavily if you remove before you are age 59.</text>

    <text>Nothing is "safe" but there are degrees of risk. US treasury bonds are safe so long as the united states continues to honour them. Its about as safe as you can get. But it pays less than inflation.

If you want something safe most experts recommend index funds. Warren Buffet recommends them. They are easy to invest in and arent very volatile. Something like SPY covers every stock in the S&amp;P. So as long as everything doesnt go under you will be ok. Also SPY beats most experts on a yearly basis.</text>

    <text>If you don't know, stay out of it. You'd almost certainly lose money. Not to mention the point isn't to make money so much as to stick it to the man. 

So here's the gist of it: buy low, sell high is the main point of stocks. But there are some who have figured out you can do pretty much the opposite. So what they do is the borrow the stocks from people who own it, sell it at it's current market value, then wait for it to drop. If they sell these borrowed stocks at $20/share and then they buy them back when they drop to $10/share, they made $10/share profit. They then give those stocks back. The key here is they need to be pretty sure the stock is going to fall. If it rises, they either have to bail and lose money or wait and accrue interest from the borrowed stocks. 

Gamestop has been failing for years, so it's become somewhat of a safe bet to do this with. In walks /wallstreetbets who sees this going on and decides to buy these stocks. They buy enough of them that it creates a demand and the price of the stocks actually rise instead of fall. Now the borrowers start to panic and want to get out, but reddit says screw you and refuses to sell, even though they'd all make money in doing so. It's about sending a message. 

So the borrowers are accruing interested and are trying to play dirty to get the prices back down. Companies like Robinhood are now playing with them by restricting buying. If no one is buying, demand goes down and prices drop.</text>

    <text>Shorts do not come with an expiration date, options do.  Shorts have to pay interest on what they are shorting because it is essentially borrowed.  If a stock pays dividends and you are holding the short on the ex-div date, you have to pay the dividend to the person you borrowed from (does not apply to GME).</text>

    <text>What normally happens is if you short a stock at say $100 and it increases to $110, you need to have at least $10 in your account, to make up for the loss, if you do happen to close your short position. 

If your unrealized losses are close to your available balance, you get a "margin call" this means you need to deposit money into your brokage account to make up the difference. If you don't... your short position automatically closes, called "liquidation".</text>

    <text>Basically, large companies had a plan to make money by borrowing Gamestop stock, then selling it, waiting for the price to drop and buying it back, then returning it. But a bunch of Redditors bought the stock instead, and are raising the prices and refusing to sell, ruining the plans those large companies had to make money, and causing a lot of chaos in the stock market as a result. They are hoping that the companies that borrowed the money are going to be so desperate to buy the stock back so they can fulfill their obligations that they'll pay anything, no matter how ridiculous the price. 

At this point, there is not much of a way for anyone who hasn't already been involved in this to make a profit from it.</text>

    <text>The one thing I'm still confused about all of this is when do the hedge funds that shorted the stock have to actually return it?  Can they wait it out for 5 years?  Is there a time limit?  

&gt;In theory the people that lent them the GME shares would call in all their collateral before it ever got to a “bankruptcy” situation.  

Is the collateral amount the lenders require a fixed amount based on the current value of the stock relative to value when initially borrowed?</text>

    <text>yes, if they can keep paying the lending fee and any dividends and any margin collateral, they can stay short for years.

However, in this case, the hedgies have also sold options, which expire Friday. It is those options that are forcing their hands, not their shorts, although the cost of maintaining the shorts in collateral and fees has to be killing them as will.</text>

    <text>401k is an employer sponsored plan. You are probably thinking about an IRA.

There is a "traditional" Individual Retirement Plan, where you can put earnings "pre-tax". So, you would pay no income tax on that money *until* you withdraw it. In retirement, you would pay tax on whatever you take out (principle *and* gains). You go traditional if you expect to earn less, and be in a lower tax bracket, when you are retired.

There is also a "Roth" IRA. Your contributions would be "post-tax"; you pay income tax on all those contributions as you earn them. In retirement, you pay no additional income tax on any money you withdraw (principle or gains). You go Roth if you are aggressively building your net worth and may be in a high tax bracket in retirement.


Yes, you can (and many people do) have 2 brokerage accounts; one "tax advantaged" retirement account and another "non-tax advantaged" account for investments that you will either need before retirement or contributions above the IRS's maximum.</text>

The problem now is now it’s the 29th and you need to buy a pillow, but so do all the other people who had the same idea you had. So, that style of pillow suddenly is in very high demand and so the price goes way up.</text>

    <text>Maybe you can answer my question then: 

If the issue here is shorting shares, not options, why do short sellers need to sell? I mean, what triggers the short squeeze spike? Wouldn’t people be better off to hold and wait for it to come down. In this case it would be a slow battle with short holders cutting losses and buying. We would only see insane numbers like $5,000/share of shorts were forced to buy due to options expiration, no?</text>

    <text>Holy sugga honey iced tea, okay I full get that!! 

Okay okay, and since the concept of shorting is "borrowing" stocks, they're eventually gonna run out of time and be *forced* to buy everything back at that time, skyrocketing prices since everyone is holding exactly for that reason, and supply + demand means that demand skyrockets. So is there actually a time limit to this, and eventually there will be a time where everyone sells like at one time?

Thanks!</text>

    <text>Right now, I still see GME at $200, where it stopped at the end of trading. Presumably the price has changed since then but I don't see anything after 4pm. Is that a limitation of the sites I'm checking?

I see that you can buy a market order (looks like a direct, immediate sale) or a limit (which I understand to mean I set the max price I'm willing to pay and it finds me a seller under that price). If I can't see the current consensus price, how would I know where to price my buy limit?</text>

    <text>This whole thing could have huge ripple effects because of what the hedge funds will have to do once they don’t have the funds to buy the shares they need to satisfy the short. 

Often the quickest way for these hedge funds drum up more buying power is to sell their other assets. 

Maybe you don’t have the $10 billion in cash you need to buy the shares you owe but you have billions tied up in other stocks. Once you start liquidating those the market gets real interesting</text>

    <text>This is more than likely going to be the case. However this will hopefully act as a wake up call to demonstrate the need for financial services regulation on the behaviour of these Hedge Funds (as they were the catalyst for the whole thing). You can’t stop individuals from simply buying stocks and holding them because that’s the basic nature of the market.</text>

    <text>No they do not have an infinite amount of shares. That’s the fucking point. These dumb ass hedge funds have so much at risk for minimal gain for them. Once they have to fulfill their short positions and have to buy shares, where are they going to get them? Everyone is holding onto their shares. This is what will drive the price to the god damn moon. The brokers were literally out of shares to buy so they had to force the market to only be allowed to sell shares today, no purchasing was allowed.</text>

    <text>There had to be a theoretical stopping point right? I understand that since they can never close out their position due to the overshorting they could be in the "infinity squeeze" but obviously that can't *actually* happen and cascade share price to infinity. Does the government have to intervene at some point and dissolve whatever remaining shorts are left after people have all finally either sold out or something? What happens to the people still holding?

I guess what I'm asking is, *what* is it eventually that's got to cause the stock to return to a normal price at some point in the future, whether that be distant or near?</text>

    <text>This is assuming that Melvins only assets are GME which is absolutely not the case. Melvin had many other holdings in many other things and would liquidate them before declaring bankruptcy which would be something the public would see. They can’t just fold and disappear from the market leaving retail with the bag like you’re implying. Honestly the way you’ve worded your statement is completely false and reads like a tactic to scare away from GME. And that’s coming from someone who hasn’t invested in it.</text>

    <text>The Gamestop situation is really more about short selling than calls (or their opposite, puts). 

When someone shorts a stock, they are "borrowing" stock from someone else who owns it and promising to pay them back / return the stock at a set time. Hoping that the price of the stock goes down by that time, the strategy then is to 1) sell the borrowed stock to some other third person for a lot of money, 2) buy replacements at a lower price later on and give the replacements to the original lender, and 3) hopefully have a bit of profit from the difference of the high and low prices. 

So that's 3 steps to the plan, and any of them could go wrong. The most obvious is what if the price doesn't decrease or even increases? Then you lose money because you have to pay out of pocket the higher price to your lender. 

Hedge funds were pulling this maneuver with Gamestop. Because there are a lot of them doing this, each of them is making their own promises to lenders and such. If there's 100 stocks and I decide to short 12 of them, that's not really a problem. But if 9 other guys try to short 12 each as well, now we've collectively got a debt of 120 stocks when only 100 exist. This is the situation they ended up in and is what's being called the "float". 

So because the hedge funds _have to buy 120% of all the stock_ that Gamestop even has, it means stock owners have literally guaranteed buyers. Depending on how badly the short sellers want it, the owners may even be able to set their own prices. 

Knowing that, a lot of people decided to go ahead and buy the stock. They are calculating that short sellers will have to buy it from them at a price higher than they purchased it for, leading to profit. This is not market manipulation or anything else, it's just seeing a business deal and taking it. 

But when a lot of people want to buy something, that tends to  raise the price. In this case, so many people wanted to get in on the train before the short sellers _are required_ to buy, that the price skyrocketed.  

And going back to the 120 shares thing, that becomes a feedback loop. It means that some shares are going to change hands multiple times before all of the short sold leases are repaid. And since they're losing money, they want it over as quick as possible; increasing the demand further, increasing the prices further.</text>

As in, the brokers forces Melvin to "hey buy the share at $500 right now or face lawsuits etc", is that true?


Also I hold several GME stocks in fidelity (cash and not margin), say price go to $10k per share and Melvin+other short sellers have trouble paying ("shits get reaaly bad" scenario), and I am placing a sell order - will **my** own broker (fidelity) have any chance to be the one taking the loss?</text>

    <text>Good question. Like anything else you borrow from bankers and lawyers, there are terms to the loan that say when the shares have to be returned. Might be a couple days, weeks, or even years. Short selling isn't usually a long term thing.</text>

    <text>The person creating the call option is REQUIRED to give the buyer of the call option 100 shares to exercise the call option with.

If the call option creator doesn't have those shares, he will need to buy them from somewhere to give to the guy who bought the call option.

This requirement of buying additional shares will drive the share price up</text>

    <text>If you use Margin you can lose more than your total investment. Margin means you are able to borrow funds from your broker to buy or sell stocks or options at an amount greater than your account value. If you choose not to have any margin- which is the default- you will not be able to put on any trades that extends you beyond your account value. So you cannot be exposed to risk greater than 100% of your account value. If you’re an amateur, just say no to margin. 

To borrow stocks to short. You must have a margin account so the broker knows how much in value against your assets they can let you borrow. If you borrow stock, which is only done for shorting purposes, your downside is unlimited. 

Ie. If you borrowed 1 share of GME at $5.00 and sold it, you shorted the stock and received $5.00 in cash. GME is now at $1,000,000. You have to come up with $1,000,000 in cash to buy the 1 share of GME and return the share back to the broker. Your loss is $999,995.</text>

    <text>Yes look up "fail to deliver".

For the most part the broker eats it.  In extreme situations like this it can take a while to get the share back.

It should probably be noted there is a lot of sec literature basically saying not to buy to cover into a short squeeze on a fail to deliver.</text>

    <text>To answer your first question, yes people have spent real money, the shares they purchased with that money have increase massively in value, so there are a lot of people that may have spent tens of thousands on stocks when the price was lower who now own stocks worth millions.

However they need to sell those stocks to actually have the millions in cash, most are holding their stock waiting for prices to go up further and sell in the future to make even more money. Some may have sold some or all of it already and realised their gains and made actual millions.

The brokers here aren't the ones that make lots of money, they are just making a very small cut every time a stock is bought or sold. If the guys on wallstreetbets win then effectively the money came from hedge funds and institutions that shorted the stock and bet it went down. If they lose then it's those same people that win. It's obviously not just a case of win v lose as it's all a profit and loss scale, but hopefully this helps!</text>

    <text>If they are only trading on their own money, then no.  The most they could lose is 100% off what they have invested.

However, if they are trading on margin (i.e trading on borrowed money), they can quickly find themselves owing much more in a losing position than what they initially invested.

Margin calls (a literal phone call from your broker saying "square up the balance in your margin account") have financially destroyed many a inexperienced trader.</text>

    <text>Imagine a bank

You save money in a bank account.
The bank knows you and a lot of other people wont withdraw it the next day.
So the banker loans the money out to someone else.

Similarly here you have a demat account (similar to bank account, just for financial securities, in this case shares that you buy)

Now a broker has a lot of people who buy and hold shares of say apple, amazon, gme, etc etc)

Now a banker knows that everyone would not sell there shares today. 
So it can easily allow its other customer to borrow and return shares.

Now remember, if you want to withdraw all your money from the bank. The banker cannot say no to you.
Similarly if you have shares your broker cannot say no to you when you want to sell it and take your money.

Its the banks headache if they have loaned out the money you deposited.
Its the brokers headache if they have lent the shares to someone you were holding.

Hope it helps.</text>

    <text>As a lender you worry when it looks like your borrower is going bankrupt. If you see them losing money super fast you’d like to insist they pay you back right now rather than risking more. In some kinds of loans (like a mortgage) they can’t do this to you but it happens in this kind of loan they have the right to do that.</text>

    <text>The other reply mentioned interest which is correct. You can see for yourself here:

https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME

Look at the "Fee" column. That's what the short sellers are paying just to borrow the stock.

Gamestop is interesting too because the interest rate is super high, compare it to a couple others:

https://iborrowdesk.com/report/TSLA

Under normal (not worldwide short squeeze target) circumstances, lending GME stock that you're bullish on would be a great way to make some cash on the side.</text>

    <text>Forgive my ignorance, but why do they need to buy it back?  All I know is that hedge fund managers have taken short positions in the option, so all they would need is for the price to go below a certain point, and all they would lose out on is the price of the option.</text>

    <text>To preface, I don’t think any of this was “bad”.  But if we take it out of context -  a group of people colluding to buy and keep a stock priced well above what anyone thinks it’s real value is, is a bad thing. 

It’s bad because it distorts the value of the stock to an extreme degree, which harms the stock market as a place where individuals can invest confidently, which also hurts companies ability to get financing. All of those are bad things, which, if unregulated, could actually benefit hedge funds at the expense of individuals in the long-term.


Counterpoint: It is completely correct to say all the bad things i mention were already happening, just to a less extreme degree. And while the people ‘playing games” were rich jerks, they were mostly playing against each other and so the little investor was only being harmed by tiny, invisible amounts (which doesn’t make it ok, just less obvious), which is why it’s been allowed to fester for so long.

My overall opinion is this is a good thing, in a ‘sunlight is the best disinfectant’ kind of way (and also a ‘holy crap this is funny’ kind of way’). I think it’ll lead to smarter and stronger regulations that benefit the little guy at the expense of the increasingly lawless institutional investors, especially if we let Elizabeth Warren take charge.</text>

    <text>Calls are bets the stock will go up to a certain price.  In recent days with the frenzy, when a call becomes available for, say, 25% higher than the current price, it has become a de facto price target, increasing the price to that level or higher.  When it reaches that level, sometimes the person that wrote the option contract will have to buy shares to "cover," further perpetuating the demand and price increase.  This is being referred to as a gamma squeeze.</text>

    <text>If a regular investor just invests their money into stocks or funds without borrowing money there is not risk that they lose more money than they have. Similarly if they only purchase options on underlying assets there is no risk of loss greater than the amount paid.

If an investor borrows money to buy the stock/funds/options they can lose their money in the underlying assets and still be required to pay off the debt.

If an investors creates a new option contract and sells that then the investor has theoretically unlimited risk under the option contract. For example a "call option" on a share of stock gives the purchaser the ability to buy a share of stock from the seller of the option at an agreed price (the strike price) up until the expiration date of the option. If you sell a call option for $2 on stock ABC with a strike price of $5 and the stock of ABC goes up to $10 then you have lost $3 on the transaction.</text>

    <text>It is limited to the stock you have if they are  'regular' long stock options (betting that the company will become more successful and profitable over time.) If you have short options (betting the company is in decline) you can lose way way more than you put in. This is why the hedge funders are scrambling so hard. They bet big that GME would fail, which wasn't a crazy idea... They weren't doing great! They borrowed the stock at a high interest with a plan to sell it back to the lender when the stock bottoms out. 

Then Reddit happened 

So hedgers are paying shockingly high rates of interest to own stock that is going up in value. They can't return the stock because they would have to pay the difference of what they borrowed at to what it's worth now, plus the interest. 

So now you got all the hedgies trying to buy in at the bottom.of the spikes which FURTHER INFLATES the price in the long run... As long as the retailer's hold their nerve and don't sell on the peaks!</text>

Long term, the market will likely correct itself, but it's not like those hedge funds just service the rich. The average person can definitely have part of their savings tied up in those funds.

    <text>I'm worried about the retail trading infrastructure collapsing at the moment of the squeeze and not being able to sell. There are institutions riding the craze as well, and guess what... when the retail market infrastructure crashes, we will see exactly what we saw today. Retail investors can't access the market, but institutions will be freely dumping their positions and cashing in ALL THE TENDIES.

The hope is that retail buyers have a large enough position together to keep the institutions from gobbling it all up. 

I'm also afraid that some retail investors who have massive unrealized gains will somehow be left in the cold due to insolvency of the system.</text>

You can immediately sell the book, and go buy one at a dollar tree for 1$ making 9$ profit, but if the book becomes impossible to find, you have to go on eBay, say 40$, and pay whatever it costs to cover your position(-30$ from your start + holding interest). Meanwhile I am calling you twice a week to cover your position and make sure you have continuing collateral for your position (shit that has value I can sell equal to the current market value).</text>

    <text>An option is an agreement to buy ("call") or sell ("put") something (in this case a stock) for a set price at a future date.

If I sell you a call option with a strike price of $20 and an expiration date of February 5, I'm agreeing to buy 100 shares of the stock from you for $20 a share, at any time before that date. If the stock is worth more than $20 a share, you most likely will choose *not* to buy them, but if the stock drops to $5 then you can give me $500 for the 100 shares.

So by selling a call option, you're betting that the stock will go up. And by buying a call option, you're betting that the stock will go down.</text>

    <text>So first thing, the term hedge fund is kinda ironic. The name implies that they’re “hedging their bets” aka theyre operating in a safe fashion. In reality, hedge funds operate under fewer restrictions than standard mutual funds, so their trade deals are much riskier than normal, but also have the potential to make more money. This high risk/high reward leads to people constantly breaking the rules to get the most profit, which is why people call them sketchy, because the attract sketchy people.</text>

    <text>You hold your stock at a brokerage firm. You don’t have physical certificates.

The firm “holds” the stock for you, but they will also lend it out. They have other shares that they’re holding for other people, so if you need to sell and they can’t get that lent share back they’ll just sell someone else’s and give you those proceeds.  It sounds more shady than it is - think of it more like a bank. The shares are deposits, and the lending out is mortgages. The bank doesn’t need to have cash on hand equal to all the deposits - just enough to cover everyone who wants to make a withdrawal.</text>

    <text>So this is why that dummy went guh. He had the loop hole preventing him from needing collateral and gave him infinite leverage basically. He borrowed way more than he could pay for unless the price decreased below the strike price? (Not sure if it's called a strike price on puts or just calls?)

So then... What happens if these things expire? It seems like a call expiring, you just end up losing the money you spent on the "coupon" right? It seems like what you're describing at the end is essentially expiration because no one would exercise a put willingly above the strike(?) price unless they were trying to minimize losses because they thought it was still 🚀🚀🚀? Like if someone bet against Apple because a new phone was expected to be delayed, but then someone found out some supply chain change was going to prevent the delay and there was also some cool new feature supposedly coming, maybe they exercise the put to not lose as much money as they would if they wait for the expiration? I have no idea if that makes sense.

If I'm on the right track, it seems like placing calls is risky but sort of manageable risk. You know the bottom is $0 so you know what you would have to potentiality cover. On a put you are up against the fucking 🌙 and the risk is basically unlimited. Is that a fair statement?</text>

    <text>Ok, i'll try my best to explain. Buckle up. this is going to be long. There is no ELI5 Version.

Buying and selling stock is done through a stock exchange via a broker (Interactive brokers, E-trade, robinhood, etc...)  If I wanted to buy let say 10 shares of apple. I would place a bid at let's say $100 per share so I would need $1000 Capital. You put this request in and once it's accepted you now own 10 shares of apple. 2 years down the road, I want to sell my apple stock which is now worth 200/share. I will simply place the bid at $200 for my $10 shares and gain a profit of $1000 (2000-1000 initial investment). 

SHORTING: Now brokers usually have settings that enable users to OPT -IN (Default Setting)/ OPT OUT for lending your shares to others. So using my example of apple shares. If I OPTED IN - a hedge funds, an institution  can "Borrow" my 10 shares to sell to other people and pay back lets say in a week or so.

**NOTE: THEY DON'T PHYSICALLY BORROW THE STOCK, BUT IT IS DONE THROUGH THE BACKDOOR- MOSTLY NAKED SHORTING AND BROKER MARKS IT ON A PIECE OF PAPER THAT JOHN SHORTED 10 APPLE STOCKS. TYPICALLY YOU SHORT ABOUT 20% OF A STOCK AND THAT IS A LOT AS WELL, ANYTHING HIGHER WILL GET YOU IN DEEP TROUBLE IF THE PRICE MOVES AGAINST YOU. YOU NEED A LOT OF MONEY IN ORDER TO DO THIS AS IT IS VERY RISKY. GAMESTOP WAS SHORTED 140% FLOAT, which means they shorted more than the available numbers of shares on the market (100%). THEY CAN'T BUY BACK ALL THE SHARES AND HAVE CORNERED THEMSELVES.**

Why would someone do this you may ask? This is so they can sell the shares of apple continuously to drive the price of the stock down and cause panic and selling event, then come in later to scoop up the shares at dirt cheap prices and pay off the borrowed shares. 

Continuing our example, lets say 1 week later, Apple is now trading at $50/share. Well the Hedge fund now can return my 10 shares, but it only cost them $500 instead of $1000. So they made a profit of $500. They can do this as many times as they want and will make money AS LONG AS THE PRICE GOES DOWN. **what about if the price goes up**? **This is where RISK MANAGEMENT comes into play. Theoretically, their loss is INFINITE, which is what we are witnessing as GameStop stock price keeps going up and they are adamant in lowering it.** 

**Now lets switch gears and dive into GameStop. As mentioned previously, it was shorted 140%. The people on Wallstreetbets found this out and recommended that hey, take a look at this, this isn't right, the company isn't doing bad. The recent sales of PS5 consoles went great, I think GameStop has potential and is undervalued. I'm not telling you to buy the stock, but hey this is where it could go. THIS CAUGHT ON FIRE and everyone bought GameStop shares only because "It's a good company, and we like this stock"** 

This is where it gets interesting. Now our old friend JOHN who shorted the apple stock, also shorted 140% of GameStop. How do you close your short position? You have to buy back the stock. Well the stock went up. So John has to buy at the higher price in order to close his position, but remember he can't close all of his position because there is not enough available shares for him to buy back. Also his loss is infinite because the price can theoretically go to infinity, If John had a million dollar short position, he's not on the hook for more than a million, he's on the hook infinite amount technically. **THIS IS THE GREATEST TRANSFER OF WEALTH WE ARE WITNESSING.**

SHORT SQUEEZE: 

Our Friend JOHN can choose to close his position only if the shareholder of GameStop agrees to sell to JOHN. If someone agrees to sell to JOHN at $100, then great he can close some of his positions, but what if they refuse? John must go to the next seller at $200 and buy the stock at $200/share. What if they refused? Next person at $300 and so on and so forth until he can close all of his position. This is where the price is being squeezed higher and higher by buyers refusing to sell their stock of gamestop.

I could type more, but I'll stop here.

    <text>I would not call that a simple question. :P But you are correct. This is done quite often by hedge funds shorting a stock and thereby manipulating the sale purely by their sell side pressure. This is why there is so much short selling. Normally short selling is extremely dangerous as you can lose a lot more than your initial investment so fewer hedge funds would engage in it if they knew retail investors could band together and squeeze them.

I don't wanna say this is an epic David and Goliath fight because there are not only retail investors going long here but it can certainly bring about some balance to the stock market in terms of short/long bets.</text>

    <text>&gt; Shorting shares is the practice of borrowing shares, selling them, waiting for the price to go down, buying them back at a lower price when that happens and giving them back to the lender. Its buy low - sell high, in reverse order. Rather than betting a stock will rise by buying it now and plan to sell later when it's worth more, you sell now and plan to buy later when the price is lower.

This is the part I need more help with.

1. Who initially owns these shares that are being borrowed? GameStop themselves? Other investors?
2. What does the owner get out of lending out their shares? If they're getting a cut of the short seller's profit, why wouldn't they just sell off their shares themselves? If they expect the value to tank in the future, wouldn't just selling now ensure the maximum amount of profit?
3. If it's expected for a stock to tank, who are the people 'buying' the shares of the short seller? I guess in this case it's WSB and the people betting against the short sellers. But more generally, I don't understand the trading of stocks and shares. Are these transactions always between a 'buyer' and a 'seller' who have to agree on the price? Is the price dictated by some outside factor? Or are you able to just hit 'buy' or 'sell' and it doesn't matter where the stock comes from? Going back to the original question of this bullet point, why would someone buy a share that's being shorted? Once the value tanks they'll have just lost money in the deal, right? The shares will be bought back by the short seller at a lower price, ensuring that the other party will just have a loss.

Edit: Thanks to everyone who replied.</text>

    <text>Right, but since the float is so small compared to the outstanding shares, they could potentially reach a point where they can’t purchase enough shares, therefore creating the same effect the short squeeze would have. And then, of course, the short squeeze would happen further amplifying those effects.</text>

    <text>Think of it from the lender's perspective. If you loaned out shares at price A, and it's shot up to price B, you can now make money on those shares yourself. Would you give them a bunch of slack and wait to get it back when it's low again, or at some point, would you say "I'm not waiting any longer, give me my shares back, I have money to make"?</text>

    <text>Interest. Small percentage on top.

And if the stock goes up, you still own it and benefit from that.

If it goes down, well you would lose money even if you didn’t loan the shares out.</text>

    <text>They don’t care about the price. They just want the share back. The thing to remember is you aren’t borrowing from other investors who care whether the share is going up or down; you’re borrowing from institutions whose business is basically just holding onto shares for investors - they basically are like a bank.</text>

    <text>You pay a small fee for the right to buy (call) a stock at a set price. Say you agree on 10$.

If the price is higher than what you agreed on (12$) you get to buy it for 10$ and make 2$.

If the price is lower, say 8, you have no interest in buying for 10$ and just lose the fee you paid for the agreement

It’s essentially a safer way to bet, but profits are smaller.</text>

    <text>They had shorts. Basically they borrowed shares, and sold them with the intent to buy back the shares at a lower price. Problem is that they borrowed far more than the market can truly bare, and the people they sold them to don't want to sell them back</text>

    <text>That's the funny thing about stocks..... they could go to the moon and be worth 100k a share... but the business itself could still go bankrupt, and visa versa you could have a very successful business and it's stocks go to the shitter for numerous reasons.

The operations of a business and stocks are two entirely seperate things, the money that's in a business never touches stocks, but it certainly can influence those values.

The only time this crosses over when you have company stock payouts to employees... in which case if the stocks do good, the employees/CEOs in theory get more cash, but again this isn't operational cash.

I doubt gamestop gives stock incentives to your grunt employees, the upper management and CEOs that held on to their stock options are certainly happy however.</text>

    <text>I own ten shares worth $20 each. So $200 worth.

The stock goes down to $10. Now let's see what happens if I lend them or not

1: Don't lend. I now have $100 worth. Cool 

B - I lend it to Tony and charge 10% interest, so $20. Tony immediately sells, gets $200.   
Then it goes down to $10. Tony buys back stock and returns them to me 

Tony gained $200 selling, minus $100 buying and $20 interest.   
Profit of $80. Cool

I get my stock back. I now have $100 in stock and $20 interest, total of $120


Geez... $120 is more than $100.

Plus, a short sale is a BET. Both sides are financially involved in opposite directions. Tony thinks the stock will go down. I think Tony is wrong and it'll go up. If it goes up, I get the profit from the increase ***plus*** the interest.

If I think Tony is right and the stock is gonna tank? I don't lend him the stock in the first place, I sell it myself</text>

    <text>I can see that in certain markets, one side thinks some big tech company is gonna go up, one thinks its gonna go down, so they are buying and selling from each other, but for companies that are, I guess outdated, shares declining, stores closing etc (at least as I've heard reported, I'm not in US, hadn't even heard of gamestop til this month). I seen somewhere it's 140% so as far as I understand it, that's some stock that's not just been sold but sold on again for a company that has very little hope (from any reports I've read/seen)</text>

    <text>Man, what a detailed response. Thanks a ton. 

Not sure I know enough of the lingo to exactly follow along but the gist is a couple feedback loops were started when WSB rallied behind GME. And the feedback loops, the two kinds of squeezes, fucked over the hedge fund that bet on GME failing. 

What exactly is diamond hands?

    <text>In your two important things, point one is wrong. A stock loan is usually open ended and does not specify when the stock must be returned. And if you have enough money or enough margin, and the lender does not recall the stock, you can hold that short forever.</text>

    <text>To avoid a total loss. The stock is still worth *something* even after it has gone down. If I just let you keep it, I lose the whole value of what it was worth when I loaned it, but if I get it back, I can still resell it for what it's currently worth and retain it *or* I can hold onto it and count on the possibility that its value goes back up.</text>

    <text>Another good one. 

You’re exactly right. Circuit breakers are meant to give the market time to “digest” any new information that may be causing extreme price fluctuations. If it happens three times in a day, trading may halt for the remainder of the day. If there are potential fraud/legal implications, the SEC/president can’t halt trading indefinitely</text>

    <text>The terms have something to do with the intention of keeping the stocks for a long time (meaning, you believe the stock will go up eventually) and intending to sell it as soon as possible (keeping it for a short time).

Other words for long and short would be buying and selling. However you can't sell something if you don't have it. So, going short also implies that you borrow the stock from one one else, then sell it immediately and buy it back at a lower price to return it to the lender).

Another aspect of long and shorts are leverage. Unlike normal buying and selling, where you buy and sell the stocks you own, leveraging makes it possible for you to buy and sell stock that you don't even have the money to buy. This gives you the ability for even greater profit, if your prediction comes true - but you also lose more money if that prediction won't come true</text>

    <text>Yes absolutely. There are tons of investing apps. Do a quick Google search and make sure instant deposits are available and that they are trading GME and AMC. Then buy as much (especially GME) as you reasonably can and hold. We only have power over Wall Street if we buy and HOLD! Even when you see that price drop you hold. If everyone holds and waits out the hedgefunds, the people win.

Edit: If people hold, the amount the stock price can go up is literally limitless.</text>

    <text>It’s not you directly that is loaning out the shares. It’s the brokerage who is basically acting as a custodian for your shares (along with a bunch of other investors). Their job isn’t to invest shares - it’s to basically act as a bank for them. If you make an order to buy shares they collect the commission from you and go out and find you the share you bought. If you sell, they take shares from their “vault” and sell them and give you the proceeds (less their commission).

Another way they earn money is by lending out shares in exchange for a fee. A lot of the shares they hold are just sitting there since the investors who actually own the shares aren’t buying or selling. So they lend them out to try and make some extra money.

They don’t really care if the price goes up or down - they just want to make sure that they get their shares back.</text>

    <text>A long position is what you traditionally think of when you imagine investing.  You buy something, hold on to it for a while, and sell it later.  If the thing you purchased increases in value during the time you held on to it, you profit.

A short position is the opposite.  You sell something, with the intention of purchasing it back later (often because you borrowed it and need to return it to its original owner).  If the thing decreases in value after you sold it, but before you buy it back, you profit.

A long position profits during when things increase in value, and a short position profits when things decrease in value.</text>

    <text>That’s not really how it works. It’s more like you’re holding shares and someone asks to borrow it and pays interest for it and promises to give it back.

It’s better than just holding the stock since while it’s shorted you are still invested and collecting interest from the short seller.

If you’re confident that having the stock is smart, then loaning it to be used in a short position does nothing but get you extra money while you hold the stock.</text>

The stock price has zero effect on the company itself.. they already sold those shares to investors, so they aren't seeing the cash.  They could say "See, everyone thinks we're worth $384/share, so here are some new shares we'll sell you for $384," but everyone *knows* they're not really worth $384/share.

At some point, reality is going to set in and the company really is going to go bankrupt and make all these shares worthless, aren't they?</text>

    <text>People bought stock for 2 main reasons.

1) They believed the company could rebound.
2) They heard or realized that there was an opportunity to take advantage of an overshorted stock.</text>

    <text>Depends how much of the initial short positions have already settled. Some have already eaten their losses and moved on. At that point it's just market actors guessing at whether the value will continue to rise or start descending towards the usual value. You can profit from it, and I have to advise that you should engage in the stock market to make money, not to fuck over specific people. If you manage to do both, congratulations. But don't cut your nose off to spite your face.</text>

    <text>Selling naked means you don't have the collateral and will get it when ya need to. Say for calls you create one of those coupons and sell it to someone and agree you will get them 100 shares of gme for 20$ they pay you 1000$ and then right now you purchase 100 shares of gme so no matter where the price of gme goes you already have the shares if needed. The downside to that is you can't really do much with that money since it's tied down in that contract, the plus side is that your loses are significantly more manageable. 

A summer or two ago some kid on wsb found a "glitch" where robin hood would credit your account for the 1000$ premium but didn't force you to keep the collateral so you just sell another contract on those same shares. A few kids (r/controlthenarrative had a famous guh) managed to run up like a million dollars with only 5 grand in collateral.</text>

    <text>You don’t have to settle within 2 days. But every day you hold it overnight, you are charged interest by the firm the loaned you the share. So you can hold it as long as you want, as long as you can pay that interest. Obviously, you can’t hold it forever or else you lose money. 

Float refers to the amount of shares that are available for trade. So short float means the amount of shares that are shorted based on that float. 

Short interest is the amount of shares short based on the outstanding shares. Outstanding shares refers to the total amount of shares in existence for that stock. Not all are available for trade.</text>

    <text>It is relevant when considering what the repercussions are going to be for the current events. I was trying to know whether shorting was a valuable tool worthy of whatever regulations are dreamed up to protect it. People are probably going to demand some sort of changes and the first thing I'd ask as a regulator/politician is "Is this a thing worth keeping?" before trying it fix it.</text>

    <text>The other answers explain why they get it back, but the reason they lend it in the first place is because they get interest off of the shares they loan. 

In cases where the stock is harder to borrow, like GME, they will also charge a flat fee, which makes it expensive to borrow, and the borrower will lose money unless the stock goes down significantly.</text>

    <text>Short positions do not expire. Put options do. A short position pays interest if it’s held overnight, and that’s paid generally on a daily basis (although it can be charged whenever, so sometimes weekly, etc... depending on the broker).

A put option is the opposite of a call option. The same way a short position is the opposite of a long position.</text>

Short is selling a stock to buy it back later (ie hoping the company fails), long is buying a stock to sell it later (ie hoping the company's share price continues to rise).</text>

    <text>I would not recommend it. In fact please don’t. The individual traders participating in the concerted effort are for the most part fairly knowledgeable about what they are doing. More importantly, these are investing money they can afford to lose. 
If you don’t know what you are doing, you can get into very real trouble trading things like potions.
That does not mean you can’t help. A successful army need drivers, medics and cooks; not just soldiers. Put pressure on your elected representative to take action on the companies that manipulate markets. The more calls and letters and emails your congressman or senator gets the more likely there will be an investigation and action</text>

    <text>They owe the people they borrowed the shares from their shares back.

They borrow shares from someone, then immediately sell them. They hope that by the time they have to return the shares that the price will have gone down, so they can buy some at a cheaper price and pocket the difference.

In this case the shares they have sold have instead gone up in value, but they still have to buy them to return them.

Buying shares increases demand, which increases their price</text>

    <text>It’s also important to note: when you purchase a call option, it’s for 100 shares, not just a single one.

So if all 100,000 options expire tomorrow, and they’re all “in the money” (the current share value is higher than what your option allows you to buy it for, which is the strike price), market makers that sell those options have to have 10 million shares to support that. Purchasing 10 million shares when there’s only about 70 million shares in total, and only 40% of that is currently in circulation, will cause it to drastically increase. That’s called a gamma squeeze.</text>

    <text>The loaners are long on the stock and likely have no plans to sell near term. They loan out the shares (with a hefty premium) knowing they will get shares back. Large institutions own most of these shares, and they can make extra money on the premium loans, while also staying long on the stock.</text>

    <text>Okay so if I'm understanding correctly, GME is deemed "artificially" valuable because more than just the stock price affects a company's valuation. Got it.

The whole "artificially valuable" thing sounds bad, BUT why is it such a bad thing (from GME'S position) to have this influx of purchased shares of its stock? The whole purpose of a company selling stock is so that it can gain additional funds needed to grow the business, fund operations, purchase assets, etc.

So why can't GME just take all this new money from stock purchases and buy itself a plan to get out of its operational run? Hire the best of the best R&amp;D team, advertising agency, etc to rebrand itself and recreate a dying business. Then with time, it'll hopefully earn itself a legitimate high valuation.

What am I missing?

Edit: Thanks so much guys! Got it now...makes sense.</text>

    <text>They go into the market so the people that still have stocks pretty much gets an opportunity to get them.

When the short position those hedge funds hold expires, they are forced to buy stocks to cover them at whichever price the stocks currently are, which means they'll have to buy billions worth of stock in one go. More stocks being bought means the price shoot up, a lot, and we will see a huge spike in the stock price when that happens. At that point, it will get to peoples sell prices and they will, of course, mass sell, so we have a huge spike down coming in right after, which should balance out and eventually, get the stock back to it's normal price, most likely making a few new millionaires out of it, while crashing out a couple billionaires. Of course, not everyone will make the big sells, most people will likely break about even or with little profit out of it, some will have losses, it varies and is a high risk situation.

Just remember, this is IF this all proceeds without intervention and the money actually makes it into the market, at this point billionaires are likely exploring every avenue to stop it from happening and it will be interesting to see what comes of it.</text>

    <text>Adding to your fantastic answer...

&gt;In comes WSB. They figure that maybe if enough people can be convinced to buy GME stock, first the price will naturally rise if enough people want to buy, and secondly well one day those short sellers will be FORCED to buy them at market price and if a lot of them have to do so the price should rise spectacularly because the short sellers MUST buy.

The reason why a short seller would be FORCED to buy is because of what’s knows as a “margin call”

Basically a lender is only going to let you borrow so much money.

Given that you have to borrow stock to short sell, and the potential loss on a short is infinite, if stock goes up in price too much you now find yourself in a lot of debt. There comes a point where the broker says “wait wait wait hold on a minute. You owe way too much money. Buy stock to close your position, or deposit additional money and prove to us you’re not broke.”

If you don’t comply the broker will close out the position for you, or they will begin selling other parts of your portfolio to get the money you owe them.</text>

    <text>all these are risky. Everything can happen as we saw today with Robinhood and co disabling buying which crashed the price for a while. 

The squeezes can still push any of these stocks 500% up or whatever. 

People could just taking profits for whatever reasons and the stocks come crushing down.

If people keep pushing GME and buying and then the squeezes happen that could in theory bankrupt some of these hedgefunds.

Does the SEC step in closing down the trading of these stocks altogether? 

If you want to be part of history and maybe make good money go ahead just be aware everything can happen including 100% loss.</text>

    <text>If you think the stock is going to rise in value in the future, you want to buy the stock outright when the price is low and then sell when it’s high to make a profit. For example, buy while the stock is $20 and sell when it hits $40. You’ve doubled your investment. If you guess wrong and the company goes bankrupt, worse case is you’re out $20.

If you think the price is going to drop in value, you want to borrow a share, sell it immediately while the price is still good, then wait for it to drop. Now you buy more stock at the new lower price, and return it to the original owner at that time to repay your borrowed stock. For example, borrow stock and immediately sell it for $40, then wait until it hits $20 to buy it back and return it to the owner. You’ve pocketed the extra $20 from when you originally sold it, so you’ve made a profit. 

But the risk here is much higher - if you misjudge and the price skyrockets, like GME is, you can be in deep trouble. Say the stock doesn’t drop to $20 like you hope but instead it increases to $100. Well, you have to pay it back no matter what, so now you’re losing $60 per share to buy it back for $100 after you had only made $40 when you first sold it. Of course the price can climb even higher with no upper limit when your loan comes due, so tread carefully with shorting stocks.

Edit: Usually you have to pay a fee to borrow the shares. The person borrowing them is betting that they’ll make more than enough money back when they sell high and buy them back low, so even accounting for the borrower fees they’re still making money. The person allowing their stock to be borrowed makes money in fees so they’re happy too.</text>

    <text>Gme could went up to 600-700 today, people would have made hundred/thousands/millions. But the hedge fund (who had just lost 2 billion the day before) would be so fucking fucked. This had nothing to do with protecting the people. Never has a company banned buying and pushed selling. They tanked the stock from just under 500 to 140. All while still letting wallstreet buy and sell it. The people got fucked today, but we’re holding</text>

    <text>In calculating risk two big factors are variability in price (this is called beta) and variance from "market fundamentals" (e.g. a stock can be considered overvalued and at risk of falling if it's price compared to it's earnings is high).

Gamestop has very wild swings in value both up and down throughout the day (so a very high beta) and it's price does not comport with its market fundamentals. Because price does not comport with market values it's likely that it will fall in the future (very likely by an astronomical amount to reach the right fundamentals). It's impossible to say when this fall might occur could be tomorrow could be in a year.

Because it has a high Beta it's very easy to lose 50% of the value of the stock in a single day.

Both of these factors mean the stock is risky.

Another way to look at it is that risk and return are two sides of the same coin. Massive returns usually come with massive risks. Because of the chance to make so much in a day there is also a chance to lose so much in a day.</text>

    <text>Shares regularly go up and down in price. The lender had no intention of selling it whether it went up or down in the short term as they believe in the long term it will go up. 

They want it back in the same way you want a screwdriver back that you lend to a neighbour. 

You don’t intend sell the screwdriver and even if it’s gone down in value on eBay it makes no difference to you. 

It’s your screwdriver you want it back.</text>

    <text>They may have portfolios and it's too much work to track and manage all of their stocks.

Another aspect with shorting is that by having a fund do it, the fund can do it on a larger scale. If a ton of shares are all dumped at once (by a shorting fund, instead of one person selling a few), this can cause other stock owners to panic and also sell out of fear of losing money, which pushes the price down further still.</text>

    <text>Shorting 101:

Imagine your friend has 10 coconuts and they're worth 2 dollars each. That's 20 dollars. You borrow them and promise to pay them back plus interest (let's say 5 percent). You turn around and sell those coconuts to someone else, thinking they'll be 1 dollar a piece tomorrow. If you're right, you give your original friend the 10 dollars the coconuts are now worth, plus the 5 percent interest equalling $10.50. You get to pocket the $9.50 extra for yourself.

Now imagine you sold your second friend 14 coconuts from the 10 you borrowed. Make sense? Of course not. That's why the hedge funds are in trouble; that's exactly what they did. This is called a naked short and it's very illegal.

The problem is that shorting to begin with is an ethically shitty tactic; you're placing a bet that a company will fail to a certain point. It doesn't add anything to a company or the economy.</text>

    <text>The current price of GME is not attached to the business's fundamentals currently, but rather by market dynamics. Believe it or not, the massive hedge funds that have taken a position in GME will resort to both dirty and not-so-dirty tricks to manipulate the price to profit, often at the expense of the inexperienced.

    <text>A broker loans the shares to a short seller.

The shares belong to regular investor but the broker loans them.

The short seller sells the stock at market price intending to buy back later at a lower price.

When its time to return the loaned stock, they pay interest/commission to the broker and the broker returns it to the investor.

The assumption is you make money off the price/company declining, enough to pay a fee to the broker and still profit.

Its detrimental to the company whose stock is being traded but it benefits brokers and short sellers, who can be large hedge funds making money for their investors</text>

    <text>Absolutely not, the WSB position (which the average joe would be taking on Robinhood by pushing Buy) can only lose at the current short volume pending government intervention, price manipulation (which is what they were doing while the Buy functionality is removed), and forcing people to sell off stocks (Robinhood did this as well today, one investor posted $500,000 in lost profit because Robinhood automatically sold his/her shares when the hedge funds managed to push the price to a certain low).</text>

    <text>It has nothing to do with GME being specifically risky. Its a company that was failing, so hedge funds took notice and begun shorting it.

The risk is the fact that the price has been artificially inflated by all the WSBs trading. Although not illegal, its sort of created a bubble where normal measures of risk and investing rules don't apply. So yes, major risk.</text>

    <text>I have no idea how to *actually* short a sock but my really inexpert understanding is if you can borrow a share with the promise to return it in 30 days, you can certainly sell it for tomorrow for $300 or whatever, then buy one at the end of Feb for $3 or whatever to give back, and make $297 in profit. I’ve no idea if this is possible.</text>

    <text>Lets say you run a mutual fund. You own stock because it is backing your fund. You don't care too much if it goes up or down, because that just changes the price of your fund. In this capacity, a lent share is basically the same as a held share, except the lent share makes you money.

This is similar to how banks lend out the money you put in your savings account.</text>

    <text>Short sellers won't get their money unless they either covered their position (managed to end the short), or they got in at the same time and extent as WSB to try and play a game of chicken.

Shorts are a gamble where there is the potential for infinite loss because the holder can name their price and the short seller MUST pay it or their other assets may be liquidated to cover the cost (bankruptcy). If I held the only "liquid" stock of GameStop, and you were a short seller who needed to cover their position, I could ask you for literally everything you own. Anything not protected by bankruptcy law is mine.

The bubble may burst. But the people holding the bag will be the hedge fund. Most of WSB don't care if someone else at WSB makes a buttload of their money as long as one of them also manages to walk away with a pound of hedge fund flesh.</text>

    <text>Because they have to pay interest on their loan and the Interest is tied to the value. So right now they are paying a lot in interest and loosing money by the day. 

They also have to prove to the lender that they have enough margin to buy back the shares and repay the loan. Meaning they basically need to keep adding money to the account as the price to buy back the borrowed stocks keeps going up. If they are not able to find that money their position is forcefully closed and there are nothing they can do about it.</text>

    <text>I’ll try.
You can own a stock, you can lend this stock, and someone else can borrow this stock.  Importantly, the person who borrowed this stock can then lend the stock to someone else and then they have the same lender/borrower relationship as the original lender and borrower (this becames important later)

Mortgage firms borrowed GameStop stocks at around $10 a stock.
To make money off this they then try and force the stock price down (short) using some nefarious market tools and means so that when the borrowed time limit comes due the stock owner has to pay them, so
say the stock drops to $5, they then get $5 profit per share they borrowed.

In this case however, GameStop stock has risen dramatically in price, to close to $400 a stock at points, so now the mortgage firms that borrowed at $10 a stock are now looking at having to pay out $390 loss per stock, and they HAVE to when the borrow time limit comes due.

Now, this is bad for the mortgage firms BUT they should have covered their bases for this and not left themselves so vulnerable.  (A naked short? Or is that the best part)

Instead, they did quite the opposite and actually managed to get into a position where 140% of the GameStop stocks had been lent and borrowed.  This is illegal (with some caveats, which don’t apply in this case).

Some very smart redditors on WSB noticed (through publicly available information) just how “over shorted “ the GameStop stock was and just how much of this was owed/owned by certain hedge funds and let Wall Street bets (wsb) know.
So people started actually BUYING GameStop stocks and this demand caused the price to rise, which caused other larger hedge funds to also buy the stock which caused it to balloon wildly.  So now the original hedge funds are stuck staring down multi billion dollar losses.  They have already tried to dig themselves out the hole through some cash injections (bailouts) from rich “friends” but this failed twice.

Over night the free stock trading app Robin Hood removed the ability to trade in GameStop stocks on their platform.  It has since come to light that the original hedge funds have a 40% “stake” in Robin Hood.

So with 140% of the stocks being “owed” and only 100% to actually go round...the original hedge funds are up shot creek without a paddle, or were, before the dodgy Robin Hood stuff...the outcome is tba</text>

    <text>Short positions have to also pay interest on the stocks that they borrowed, until the position is closed. This information is crucial. They can’t hold forever. So if you short now, and it doesn’t go back down soon, how long are you willing to wait?</text>

    <text>This is an excellent answer. I’d add two details to differentiate why this is different than other “short squeeze” situations which happen on a somewhat regular basis.

- the main differentiator is the buyers (Reddit army) would usually be either uncoordinated random people or a large institution like another hedge fund. So when the squeeze was successful and the price jumped, they’d just sell and take the win. What the Reddit army did, at great risk to their profit, was try to hold on to the shares, so the short sellers would get increasingly desperate. This usually won’t work because you couldn’t coordinate enough people to hold on to tens of millions of dollars worth of stock when there is a nice chunk of profit right there, but they did it.
- the earlier post correctly discusses why short selling is especially risky. What it doesn’t mention is how hedge funds are highly leveraged, meaning at any given time, they might not be able to close out all their positions. This is common in investing, especially with large institutions, but it meant it was especially difficult for the hedge fund to hold on to their position, which caused the escalating panic, and the snowball effect.</text>

    <text>Its possible but unlikely. The normal course for that is to stop allowing buying on margin. Basically you can buy but you have to have cash to do so. The decision they took is not the normal course. Usually the broker doesnt want to be involved in your stock choices since they dont want to be involved if you lose. Let the buyer beware. Here, given the actions and the squeeze it seems unlikely they were worried about their clients.</text>

    <text>Both the borrower and lender have incentive to do so. Borrowers want to short and lenders are normally long-term investors who don't want to sell any shares and own a lot of them, so the interest they get from all the stocks they lend is a good way to make profit without losing stocks.</text>

    <text>In the long term yeah. In the short term, there's probably going to be more market-wide volatility due to hedge funds selling other stocks to have enough cash on hand to cover their short GME positions. Not to mention just the fear that this could happen may temporarily drive other traders into less-risky assets like gold, silver, and bonds. Hard to say how much volatility though.</text>

    <text>No, the only way the hedge funds can save themselves is by forcing the stock price down as low as possible to get out of their risky positions. Retail traders keep buying and holding their stocks to keep the stock price high, which incurs virtually unlimited risk for the hedge funds until they finally decide to call it quits and just take the loss. 

RH kept retail traders from buying and holding more shares to intentionally help the hedge funds (aka their investors) settle some of their positions. The vast majority of retail traders (at least the ones who got in semi early and have held through the chaos) understand the risk they are taking with their positions and understand that the institutions have much more to lose than they do.</text>

    <text>So there is two things stopping that:

1. You actually have to rent out the stock (interest payments). So every day you are haemorrhaging money, even if you don't buy the stock
2. The price may NEVER drop below the price they shorted it at. Reddit users could hold on to it past Covid-19 and allow Gamestop enough time to rebuild their business.</text>

    <text>GameStop has been a business on the decline for years.  

Investing firms gambled that they would continue losing value.  So they borrowed stocks that people owned and sold them (short selling) at that market price.

Normally, they would buy it back later for a lower price and keep the difference in prices as profit.

However, the level this was done has made it nearly impossible for them to buy back all the stock.  This is being exploited and driving demand up which causes the price to skyrocket.

Thus, the firms are losing billions of dollars.  The investors (WSB and others) are holding onto their stocks so they can't be bought by the firms to continue the price increase.

When the firms buy back the stocks, the price will raise in a "short squeeze" due to demand which will greatly increase price.</text>

And then after they agree on the plan, they'll short the company, and then they'll release statements, news articles, analysis reports, etc to drive the public perception of the company into the ground, then reap the rewards. 


But they got real greedy and overextended themselves and shorted over 100% of the stock (as OP posted), which is actually illegal.  [It's called Naked Shorting](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nakedshorting.asp), and now they're reeling.  They've (trading apps such as Robinhood, and their backers (Citadel) done a ton of shady shit to try to stem the money they're losing from the naked shorting. 

And now they're shitting their pants and crying foul when they're finally being beaten at their own game. 

On a side note, there does seem to be actual value in gme, yes they're a antiquated game store... but they've been going through some restructuring and some very smart ppl on WSB have done their research, and bought in way back in July **of 2019**  Here's the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZTr1-Gp74U</text>

    <text>To be honest, I’m not sure - my guess is that there aren’t necessarily sufficient puts with the strike prices / terms that they want. I suspect that the actual short trade is probably a bit more complex than just straight shorting and buying puts though.</text>

    <text>It's also important to mention that the hedge funds that over shorted the stock created a situation where being irrational is potentially profitable. Although it's a bit of a prisoners dilemma situation. If most stock holders continue to hold, price will continue to go up and make a lot of retail investors a lot of money. If a significant enough of stock holders end up selling, it'll cause the price to plummet and the sellers will make out like bandits with 0 risk but all the other investors get screwed to one degree or another.</text>

    <text>Please do not invest what you can't afford to lose. As many people in this thread have said, this whole event is about sticking it to hedge funds, not profit. GME is artificially inflated atm because of what's going on. Markets are volatile and this is a big gamble. You very realistically will lose all $300.</text>

    <text>It depends on how many years until you retire. From when the stock market crashed in the dotcom bubble, it took 7 years to recover. If you had to retire in 2003 then the bubble burst really screwed you. If you were young then actually getting to out money to work after it burst worked out great for you as of today.</text>

    <text>So to short you have a contact date to return the stocks by, and that date is today, actually. Now the contract doesn't just expire, but because they haven't returned the stocks they need to start paying a premium, and that's a premium on 70 million stocks. 

WSB is holding on until the bleeding caused from paying the premium outweighs the estimated value that they may receive by holding on until the stock dips. That's why today isn't D-Day, it's truly just the beginning</text>

The executives are definitely benefitting though, and you can see this by checking insider trades and see that they've been dumping their holdings throughout January, full on cash out, exactly what I'd be doing if I were them!</text>

    <text>Sort of but not at all in the way that you'd expect. There are two main reasons I'm aware of that prompted the halt - clearing house collateral and SEC net capital requirements.

The first is kind of just an operational thing - when you buy a share or engage in a transaction it takes 2 business days for an entity to ensure everything goes smoothly and everyone gets their payment / shares. During those 2 days, the brokerage has to post collateral for the shares in proportion to how risky it is or how likely it is that the transaction will fail. Since these costs started skyrocketing, many brokerages did not have the money to post that collateral and were forced to halt trading on these expensive-to-clear trades.

The second is the net capital requirements, designed to protect consumers in the event of the failure of the brokerage. My understanding of this is that at all times, the brokerage needs to hold a certain percentage of all the money they could potentially owe if they instantly went bust. Sounds silly, but when these were revoked in 04 for some banks it caused a major crisis in 08 when those banks couldn't pay back their debts. Anyways, the percentage you need to owe for a given stock again depends on the volatility - so skyrocketing GME prices meant these capital requirements also started to increase. I suspect this isn't as major as the clearing costs, but it is a regulatory thing designed to protect "the average joe."

I don't think it's a brokerage's place to decide which investment decisions are best for their users and I don't believe any brokerages are doing so aside from notifications that some stocks are risky.</text>

    <text>A regular short means you borrowed actual shares to sell.  A naked short is when you sell shares you don't even have access to in the first place, with the intent of buying them later and fulfilling the order.

It's like, you call a caterer and order service for a party in 2 days, they accept, but don't actually have the food at the time of the order, they're naked catering.  They'll buy the food the next day and provide it to you, but have to do so at whatever prices food are that day.</text>

And the people lending those shares out are brokers - think of it as a parking lot operator. They lend out cars that get parked there. The people who actually own the cars don’t mind because the parking lot is guarded and secure and they know they can come get their car whenever they want.</text>

    <text>One thing lost here is that they must pay a lending fee based on the current market price of the borrowed stock, which they are holding in colossal amounts. So it's a matter of balancing if they can realistically play the waiting game while they're bleeding from fees alone. It's bloody either way, there's no other way around it other than overtly cheating the market. As it stands, it might be easier to commit a federal crime and pay the fees that actually closing on their positions.</text>

    <text>Massive amounts of call options expiring ITM is a gamma squeeze. Basically when a call option is exercised on its expiry date, a broker buys the shares and gives them to the person who exercised the call. They then go to the clearing house to get the money from the put option paired with the call option that also just expired and ask them for the amount of money equivalent to the cost of the shares.
Now, in a trading platform like RH, it seems to happen instantly, and thats because RH uses its own capital to buy the shares straight away and then settles the deal with the losing party over the next couple of working days.
If there are too many call options to buy shares for, not only does the price get jacked up by the sudden demand (and i mean on the way to infinity) - RH might also run out of liquid capital to buy the shares with, which would be a failure to deliver their end of the bargain (can anybody say lawsuit).

Non option shorts generally dont expire, you can roll over your position provided you can meet the capital requirements (which may be anywhere from a small portion of the current share value, or multiples of it depending on volatility) and the interest payments on the loaned shares. Or you can decide to close your position and buy the shares to return to the loaner.</text>

    <text>This is a tricky thing. If we’re taking 401(k), this is likely to only have a neutral to positive impact on the balances. I doubt many plans had funds that included GameStop stock, but maybe some did. So, in those cases- the stock going up is good for them- so long as they sell before it bottoms out.

You’ll see some people catastrophize about pensions, to which I would say “it’s possible,” but I would also say that Pension Fund trustees should NOT be looking to hedge funds for gains- they’re risky and generally under-perform the market, and neither of those things match the purpose of a well-run pension- predictable gains over the long term.</text>

    <text>That is something that should get looked at. Some of these Hedge Funds also manage 401k's and Pensions.  


Typically speaking, most companies do not simply have money just laying around. Which raises the question, if the Hedge Fund suddenly produces money to pay for things- where did the money come from? Did they "borrow" some money from a fund they manage?</text>

    <text>No. Firstly, there are much much bigger fish buying into this besides redditors and they will always be able to afford it.

Secondly, the hedge funders getting fucked over right now NEED to buy shares because they borrowed and sold them a long time ago. Now, they need to buy them back to return them otherwise the interest from the borrowed shares will fuck them sideways and bankrupt them. The act of them buying shares drives the price up even more though, making it harder for them to buy back the amount that they borrowed. 

Problem is, they borrowed and sold more shares than actually exist in real life. This means that they literally cannot buy back all the shares, so the price can reach the tens of thousands if nobody sells.</text>

    <text>Short selling on margin (borrowed money) has an interest rate for those shares. It can often times be very high, like 30%-80%. The reason why hedge funds can't wait long term for the price to even out is because they have borrowed billions. Paying 30% interest on a billion is $300 million dollars a year. The longer you wait the lower the price would have to get for you to break even on the original trade.</text>

    <text>Most likely not. Hedge funds initial purchase amount is typically more than the average investor could meet. They may also require you be an institutional investor - either an entity or a person with sufficient experience to appropriately evaluate the value and actions of the managing fund.

Also, depending on your 401k and other retirement plans, hedge funds are considered too risky to be included as potential investments in the plan. 

Hedge fund shares are not publicly traded, so buying on a stock exchange isn't possible.</text>

    <text>nope, these were top hedge fund shorters. If you are shorting a stock at that level then you have a lot of money to risk. If they were normal they would have bought bought shares. But what they did was coordinate a manipulation and try to get their rich buddies to manipulate with them as well to basically bankrupt gamestop</text>

It’s like you parked your car outside, then this car salesman comes along with a copy of your key and rents out your car to some random guy. After a week, the salesman Puts your car back like nothing happened. The salesman keeps the rental fees he charged the random guy, and you stay non the wiser. 

What happens if the guy who rented your car crashed it? Now the salesman has to return the car AND repair the damages before you find out.

This is what’s happening right now. Basically these salesmen have to fix these cars but Redditors bought most of the parts and spare cars before the salesmen could. So, now there’s nothing for these salesmen to fix the car with: they can’t replace it or buy new parts which forces them to come to us to buy the new cars and parts. The longer we don’t sell to them, the more they’ll want the parts. High demand for these car parts also drives up the prices per part. Think of an auction. 

————————————————
#Long Explanation Below

Options work like bets; they can be for or against a company, and are set at a specific price for a specific date. The bets are dealt as Options Contracts and the wager is 100 shares per contract. There’s always a Buyer and Seller of a Contract. 

When you sell short, you’re basically betting against a company in hopes that it loses money. So they can make a bet like this: “The current price of a GameStop share is $30 right now. I think the shares will be $15 by April 12, 2021. If I’m right by April 12, 2021, you have to buy GameStop shares from me no matter how low they drop.” — so if a Short Seller is right and the GameStop shares drop to $15 or lower, the Buyer of the Contract IS OBLIGATED (they HAVE to buy the stock from the Seller, that’s how Contracts work and this is why the Squeeze exists) to buy the 100 shares of the Options Contract at the lower price, no matter how lower the share’s price drops; a net loss of at least $15 per share for the Buyer. These shares all now sold to the Buyer at a discount for the Seller. The Seller of the short Contract gets to pocket the $15 profit on each share once he sells the Shares to the Buyer or sells the Contract to someone else, making the Buyer owe someone else. 

How “Naked Shorts” work is that these Short Sellers are wagering shares of GME they don’t own. They’re selling what we call “Uncovered Puts”. If the Sellers had the shares, they would be Covered or safe. But since they are borrowing the shares, they are Uncovered or unsafe. These shares that they have to borrow to create the Contracts are from actual shareholders who have no idea that their shares are being wagered. 

What’s happening now is Reddit betting on GameStop, saying the price will instead go up. So now, the Short Sellers are losing their bets that expire starting today. The Naked Sellers are screwed because they have to buy shares to Cover themselves but here’s the fun part: WE BOUGHT MOST OF THE SHARES. So now they have to come to us to buy the shares back at inflated prices in order for them to return it to the actual shareholders. So when we hold, we control the demand. And as economics taught us, if demand goes up, prices go up, too.</text>

    <text>Not really. Some big wall Street bet to much on falling stocks and people noticed and tool the opposing gamble (buying stock). At some point it became a gambling stock, which at some point will normalise again.

The stock market has little to do in how the companies are economically. If it was Tesla could buy every other carmaker, but in reality they produce way more cars than Tesla. (As a measure who is "bigger" in traditional terms)</text>

    <text>Personally, I'd treat $100 of GME as $100 invested in screwing over wall street. If I happen to have the opportunity to sell at even $20 later (i.e. a 80% loss), then that's just a retroactive 20% discount on screwing over wall street.</text>

    <text>The main thing I would add is, depending upon the source, short sellers may have lost over 70 Billion dollars already with (seemingly) more to come. Melvin capital has drawn most of the ire from WSB and if WSB wins, Melvin will probably have to declare bankruptcy, which could have a cascading effect. Citadel is a hedge fund that either owns or at least lent Melvin a bunch ($1-2 Billion).  Citadel also runs orders for Robinhood and buys their user data, so when Robinhood halted trading today, many people have taken that to mean Citadel forced RH to do it, but that is speculation. 

What we do know is Citadel's senior advisor is Ben Bernake, who was the federal reserve chair in 2008, so many people equate those problems to the problems currently happening.</text>

    <text>Disclaimer: I'm just some idiot gambling with money i can afford to lose in pretty much the same way I think you are

I'm buying like 3 shares or whatever I can afford with the money i have to lose tomorrow morning, and I'm not going to sell them until the prices skyrocket. We **know** this is going to happen because brokers will **need** to buy these shares to fulfill the contracts they've made over the past few months/weeks/days.

They've "sold" more shares than actually exist; what happens when demand exceeds supply?</text>

    <text>Gamestop benefits from the publicity, for sure.

As for direct financial effects, their employees and executives who own stock or options benefit. The company could, hypothetically, do a secondary public offering (creating new shares out of nothing to sell) to bring some money into the company itself, but this would completely destroy the short squeeze plan, since the shorters could then buy those shares to cover their positions. So, they really don't want to do that.</text>

    <text>There's a fat chance that there was a timing 'outplay' from the redditors.
They may have had the information about some big short agreement's expiring time and hit just the right time, so that they will need to buy them soon.
Short selling is usually not a long term move.</text>

    <text>The buyers aren't the ones who decide buy prices, the sellers are. If no one is willing to sell for $200, the buy price won't go below $200. So if redditors are interested in holding and never selling, the price won't go down.

That's why everyone is telling you to hold.</text>

    <text>You should also add in this case that the short interest was 140% meaning the shorters borrowed more shares than avail which is what set this up specially.  Other stocks are shorted all the time and are not always subject to the squeeze.</text>

    <text>Hedge funds borrowed shares to sell. They have to buy shares in the future to give back.

So, i borrow 100 shares from you, which I sell for $10 each. I promise to give you 100 shares back next week. (cash in 1000)

I have to buy the shares back from the open market. If I can buy the shares for less that $10 each(E.G. 9 = CASH OUT 900)  , then I make a profit (100)  If they cost more than $10 each ( e. g. 11 = cash out 1100) then I have to cover the difference (100).

My understanding from non USA market : 
With futures, the only money that is due is the profit/loss on the future date.

The 70bn goes to all the share owners that sell back to the hedge fund (obviously a lot more than just 100 shares)</text>

    <text>In recent news the funds have suffered losses because they "short" sold options (shares in companies like gamestop)

This is like if you had magic card that was worth $100, I would say "can I borrow that card? I'll give it back to you in a month" you say yes. I take it and sell it for $100.

The trick is that I think the card will get less valuable (maybe I think some other card will come out that does what it does better) by the time I have to give it back to you.

If I'm right the month passes and these cards are only worth $10! I spend $10, buy the card and give it back to you. We are all square and I have $90 in my pocket.

But what if I was wrong or some large group of people get together and start trading that card for $200. I sold it and I owe you a card... I have to spend $200 to get you your card back, and I'm out $100!

So where did the money go? They have to "cover" their options (commitments to purchase shares) and everyone on reddit started making the thing they promised to buy very expensive, so they had to spend a lot more than they sold them for initially to a tune of $70bln $so far</text>

    <text>I think it’s important to say:

The housing market crashed due to banks giving out loans to everyone, regardless on whether or not they could pay it (they didn’t do their proper due diligence, and gave loans to easily without managing the risk, knowing that if shit hit the fan, they would be bailed out by the government. Because banks are necessary).

The people who shorted the housing market understood this, and saw the cliff before we reached it, and took a short position to profit massively. Not bad, just smart. The banks were the irresponsible ones.

With GameStop, hedge funds all decided to short GameStop because the price was dropping. Due to so many people shorting the stock, which requires selling it, the price began dropping faster than it normally would have. They artificially dropped it due to the shear amount of shares they sold short. The stock became undervalued first. The hedge funds in this case were the irresponsible ones. 

The argument can be made that it’s not actually overvalued at the moment, because the fact is, if you know someone has to buy something from you no matter what, it inherently has more value.</text>

    <text>In the case of Melvin Capital, they would have borrowed the stock from another large fund that had significant holdings in GME. Ordinary shorts (different from say, put options) don’t have a maturity date, so the borrower doesn’t have to give them back at any given date. The lender can ask for them back, but rarely do because it’s bad for business, and they’re perfectly content to sit back collecting fees (that’s the incentive) for the stock they’ve lent out.

What’s especially bad about this particular short squeeze, is that Melvin’s margins account (money they have to keep on hand to guarantee stock buy back should the lender call) would have been enormous, because of how expensive GME became. Meaning they would have had to sell off a ton of other stock in their portfolio, just to create liquidity necessary for their short.</text>

    <text>You never know if your stock was lent out or not just like you never know if the money in your bank is being lent out. Your broker/bank just hope that not everyone needs stock/money at the same time that they can lent it out. Your stock is yours and you can choose to sell when ever. It is on your broker duty to have the stock you owned when ever you need it.</text>

    <text>I’d say not that 70 billion were “lost” but that were transferred into the economy, directly where it would flow the fastest. So many folks bought in (and enough cashed out a good bit) that it was basically a bunch of very well-heeled people losing their asses and effecting a huge transfer of wealth to the “middle class”.</text>

    <text>Not a financial advisor so take this with a grain of salt, I just like the stock. You can buy fractional shares on platforms. So you don't need to spend a full $300. In my opinion you will either see much more blatant market manipulation by the billionaires to cover their asses tomorrow or you will make a profit. I personally don't think $600 dollars is a crazy expectation for tomorrow. GME, AMC, NOK hold the line and squeeze.</text>

    <text>Don’t take my word for it but,

I believe it’s because of the brokers pressuring the shorters. They lend their shares to the shorters for them to sell. However since the stockprice keeps increasing those brokers want to ensure they get their shares back before the shortsellers can’t match the price anymore and go bankrupt.</text>

    <text>The only way to do it safely would be to limit your investment to an amount you are prepared to lose entirely. There is no floor to the value of something like doge coin, it's based entirely on everyone agreeing it's worth something. So if you must buy some, make sure that if it goes to zero, you'll still be ok.</text>

    <text>I lend you my book, which you have to return to me on Friday. 

You sell that book to Bob for $10. 

Bob lends you his new book, and you have to return it to him on Saturday. 

You now owe two people the same book, but not necessarily at the same time. 

You return the book to me on Friday. You ask to buy it from me (because you have to give it back to Bob tomorrow). 

You want to pay $8 so that you earn $2 in total ($10-$8=$2). 

However, I discovered you owe Bob this book that I now own. And if I don't sell it to you, you can't give Bob back the book you borrowed from him - which is stealing. 

Now I can name any price I want. This is the squeeze.

The difference here is that there are thousands of people and thousands of books involved, but a few guys got caught over-exposing themselves, and as long as the people who hold the books now refuse to sell, the price will keep going up and up and up as the other guys get more desperate to procure books they've already sold.</text>

    <text>Could have? They're still 120% short. At this point holding GME contract is a suicide note, memes aside there is a real chance that this squeeze might literally liquidate the entire Citadel bank. And the squeeze hasn't happened yet by the way, if that wasn't clear. That's why they're scared, that's why they tried pulling every shenanigan in the book - even to a point where policy makers started asking questions, and it still didn't work. A couple $b in loses is nothing. And it has nothing to do with GameStop as a company, and it has nothing to do with people trying to make or lose money. It has nothing to do with money and everything to do with sending a message.</text>

    <text>The money supply is simpler.

Federal Reserve sets the "cost" of money, in interest. That's how much a bank has to pay another bank for money, these days virtually always (effectively) nothing.

Those banks then mark up the cost of money to derive profit and cover risk, and then onsell money to any and all customers they can find that can afford it, in the terms of loans.

So it's limited only by demand from credit worthy borrowers (as deemed by the too-big-to-fail banks), until eventually the Fed lifts rates due the economy running too "hot".

With stocks, there's a heap of regulations, leakages from the system (such as WSB buying and holding), and costs that ultimate limit the extent of multiplication possible.</text>

    <text>&gt; why is there financial incentive for somebody to lend their stocks like this

They have to pay interest on it while it’s borrowed.

Also, btw, they have to have funds available like 125%-150% of the stock’s value just in case. If the stock goes up a lot then they have to come up with more funds (perhaps by selling other stock) which is called a margin call.

    <text>The whole process around borrowing stock can get quite complex and there's a whole sub-industry around it called securities lending. The short answer is that, yes, someone is offering their stock to others to borrow. For example, a large asset manager like Vanguard holds very large amounts of stock, and very often for much longer periods than more speculative and stock-picking hedge funds. That means they can earn additional revenue by lending out that stock to whoever is willing to borrow it (key point which I'm not sure was mentioned before - you pay a fee to borrow).</text>

    <text>Most of the time, the shares are purchased using some leverage (i.e. debt). Now the lender here wants to cover their risk, and therefore will have a limit on how much the price of the shares can appreciate before they call back their loan. 

So once the share crosses that point, the short seller is forced to essentially have their loan recalled (margin call) and purchase (return) the shares back to the broker.</text>

    <text>Stock exchange provides the infrastructure to allows sale of shares by matching buyers and sellers.

Brokers deal with individuals and entities and help aggregate trades and act as an interface between traders and stock exchange. They also offer other services like lending etc and charge a fee per trade (brokerage).

Clearing house settles the trades executed in the stock exchange and make sure the correct shares go to the accounts they're destined for.

    <text>Someone correct me if needed, but I think that's why they're saying this is a unique situation that doesn't come around very often. When the brokerages collectively shorted over the % of actual stock, it wasn't as absurd a spread as it is now, and through normal market ebb and flow, they sort of bet that they could cover it all. Now they're effed because "A B and C" are going to break each other's kneecaps to get their $1 back.</text>

    <text>&gt; Market Maker

Only makes money off of having lots of orders to pick from. Lets say the highest bid price is at ETrade and the lowest asking price is at Ameritrade. I pay to have both orders go through me and give the ETrade guy a slightly higher buy price and the Ameritrade guy a slightly lower sell price, and keep the difference. In exchange, I'll pay ETrade and Ameritrade a small fraction of that cost. Very low revenue per transactions (tiny fractions of a cent) but it adds up big. Literally only makes money off of bid / ask spreads, and tries really hard to have no stake in the market despite all the orders.

&gt; Broker

The place you buy your stocks from. Back in the day it used to be a person that you would pay like a personal attorney, but these days there are free services that will act as a broker for you (they make money from the aforementioned market makers)

&gt; Clearing house

The one who actually makes sure the money and the shares get to where they need to be. There are some that I think every order needs to go through. When you buy a stock it actually takes 2 days for the stock to actually be registered as yours, but you can still trade the ghost stock in those 2 days. A lot of controversy is arising from the fact that some brokerages have halted trading because they're being asked to post very high collateral for certain stocks in case something goes bad in those 2 days.

&gt; Stock exchange

The place where the shares are actually listed for brokers to publicly buy. Ordinary people have to go through a broker since there's a lot of overhead that you need a degree and stuff to handle. Companies list their stocks on these exchanges, the biggest two of which are the NYSE and Nasdaq. A long time ago these used to be physical places where people would literally trade stocks by hand, but nowadays it's mostly just an entity.</text>

    <text>The brokers don't pay anything directly because of this, they are the ones who are owed.  If hedge funds go insolvent, the brokerage firm loses the potential profit - most of which is probably tied up in internal margin trades.  This creates a bubble for brokerage firms associated with Melvin and Citadel that will likely get shorted by behemoths like Blackrock and Vanguard.

The hedge funds are the ones who are paying out of the nose.  They pay a % based interest on the worth of the stock at close.  Right now the premium rates on those interests are at about 1 billion a day.

The brokers who initially had the stock available for purchase to short have automated systems that have essentially tied that money up in other trades - this is called their exposure.  Those trades will become insolvent and called in by other brokers to cover their own exposure.

This leads to insolvency, where hedge funds and brokerage firms no longer have the actual "printed" money to pay their obligations and they then are forced to file bankruptcy.

What makes this so unique is that the clientele that currently owns a majority (not all, but a majority) of GME stock will not suffer catastrophic losses if it tanks.  They cannot be bullied or scared into selling.  Citadel and it's hedges actually attempted to scare them into selling by tanking the stock (by throwing 3bn+ dollars at the problem) and a pathetic amount actually sold.  That money essentially evaporated.

This event is huge.</text>

    <text>Everyone seems to say no, but personally I think yes. Tuesdays 10AM 3% crash was caused by the hedge funds emergency liquidating holdings that compose the S&amp;P. It is a self feeding cycle. They dump shares of companies which COMPOSE the S&amp;P, then the S&amp;P ETF dumps, which then in turn dumps the OTHER companies that compose the S&amp;P, then the algos take over and say "oh shit something is happening."

If it blows through the algo stops when this happens, it may take a massive dive.

Edit: for what its worth, someone purchased over 60 million dollars worth of S&amp;P puts expiring tomorrow.

Or is it like a casino deal where you have all your shares and you trade em in for the money those shares are worth?

    <text>Good, but you've conflated a couple of things.. let me untangle them for you. 

If you borrow shares to short them, you technically don't have to cover so long as the owner isn't demanding them back, IF you maintain proper margin and pay all the fees and dividends. If the position gets away from you, and you can't meet your margin call, your broker is *required* to close out your position. Not to do so would expose the brokerage and all its customers' assets to loss. 

Because of that, the hedgies under pressure called their buddies, and got some backstop funding to buy them some time. But they are under the gun because they also sold *uncovered call options* on GME. 

Briefly, an option has three things: price, buy/sell ('put/call' in the biz), expiry date. GME50CallJan21 gives me the right to buy 100 shares of GME at $50 (the 'strike' price) from you (regardless of GME's price at the moment) until the 3rd Friday of January 2021. On that day, the option can have one of two values, depending on GME's price. If GME's price is over $50 (say $65), the option's value will be 65-50 = 15, I will 'exercise' my option, and you will have to sell me GME for $50, and I'll sell it in the open market for the difference. If GME's price is at or under $50, the option is worthless, and I'll just let it 'expire'. The most important thing to understand: an option is nothing more than a *bet* on the stock price. 

Who uses options? Say I owned 100 shares of GME I bought at $15. It doesn't pay any dividends, and it's not going to make any money for two years. Some one offers me $0.50/share if I sell them a call option at $20/share that expires in three months. To me, that's a good deal. If I keep renewing every three months, I get $2/yr income on my $15 stock. Not bad! And if the stock does go up, well, I sell my $15 stock for $20. I might have missed the big boat, but I don't lose money. OTOH, the guy who bought the call for $0.50 is happy that it's now worth $5 or more. So options can be used as a low-risk way to generate income, at the expense of future gains. 

But, you can also sell *uncovered call options*. Those are options when you don't actually own any GME stock. Instead, you just post sufficient margin collateral with the exchange, and maintain it as GME's price goes up or down. Since you can use the value of other stocks you own as that collateral, this gives you a way to get the premium income from selling the option, without actually buying GME. 9 times out of ten, these options expire worthless, and the big rich guys rake in thousands of bets from the small guys. 

There's no limit to how many of these uncovered calls you can make other than how much margin you can post. So once again, the number of negative bets against the stocks can actually exceed the number of shares available, as you can sell options regardless of whether you own the stock or not. This is what the hedgies have done: sold large number of uncovered call options. That means they are out of time on Friday - they *will* have to make good on their bets. And that's why they are quaking in their boots. 

 If you have sold an uncovered call, you can close it out in two ways: buy a corresponding call back in the open market, or buy the underlying stock. 

But no one's who bought those GME50 calls  will sell them when it's trading at $300. They're sitting on a $250 goldmine that might explode on an options expiry day like Friday. And the hedgies can't buy the stock either - last I saw, the "Ask" was over $3,000. So if nothing happens, on Friday, the hedgies will have to cough up the difference between those $50 ($40 and$60and$70...) calls, and whatever price GME settles at tomorrow, or whatever price the call holder decides to cash in on. If it hits $500, some might sell; others might wait for $800 (both might be disappointed, of course). 

Settlement days often have wild swings in the price of stock, as depending on how many are short at what price, there will be swings as pockets of supply and resistance are hit. Execution time on trades can be vital, and the big boys have a huge advantage there. I expect to see stories of how people were screwed showing up on reddit next week.</text>

    <text>Market maker = institution that invests enough money that they can single handedly change the price of a stock

Broker = company that allows you or other companies (like market makers) to buy stocks. They are like the stock dealer. Robinhood is a broker for me and you, Goldman Sachs is a broker for rich people and hedge funds (market makers)

Stock Exchange = place where companies lost their stocks and the brokers go to buy the stocks and give them to their clients</text>

    <text>The shorters from Wall Street have never ‘bought’ a stock. They BORROWED them from a broker and immediately sold them to someone else. The billions they are paying is rent to keep borrowing them. Once they stop paying rent, they have to buy enough shares to give back to the broker. 

They shorted 140% of available GME stocks, so the Wall Street people will have to buy EVERY stock available and then 40% again. This is required by law, so prices will go up an insane amount and everyone with GME stock is getting a lot of money by selling at a very high price. 

All that the regular stock holder has to do is keep holding onto the stock, don’t sell and wait until Wall Street cannot pay anymore rent for borrowing the stock :)</text>

    <text>The guys below are correct that its just the companys decision. You should know that share price is not indicative of value. For instance AAPL has a share price of around $130.  BRK.A has a share price of around $350,000. BRK.A is not worth more than AAPL because AAPL has way more shares outstanding. Share price x share count =market cap (value of company)</text>

    <text>It's important to note that most people now are buying GME expecting to lose that money, or to hold that stock for the rest of their lives. It would be very expensive and not financially practical to buy now, but it would be a major blow to the billionaires who constantly rig the market to steal from the poor. 

You can if you want to be a part of the anger, and probably the class action lawsuits that's coming. You shouldn't if you can't afford to lose the cost of the share.</text>

    <text>I dont want to scare you but there is a theory out there that this could have a very deep impact on the broader market. Essentially these Hedge Funds who are short GME and other stocks, own large amounts of normal stocks which if GME continues to rise they will need to sell in order to get out of the short on GME. This would push other stocks down and possibly start a Gamma Squeeze down, which means the exact thing that caused GME to go up initially with people buying options can have the same effect but going down. There are also concerns about liquidity(not enough cash in hand) for the clearinghouse that process all the trading and make sure everyone gets paid. Just keep your eyes open and don't panic.</text>

    <text>Lets start with a baseline: there is a city, and in that city people are **trading apples**.


&gt;How does buying and selling stocks work?

If you want to buy an apple, you can walk up to a shop (a middle man, a broker) and ask them to buy an apple. The shop owner then gets apples from the farm or from someone else and sells them to you at the price that is agreed upon. If you want to sell an apple, you can set a price or agree to a price that the shop owner wants to buy your apples at.

If more people want apples, the price goes up, as there is more demand and fewer apples. The sellers can ask more money.
If less people want apples, the price goes down because they might be stinky apples no one wants.

&gt;What is short selling?

You have an apple. Its worth $10 in your city. I walk up to you, and I tell you, let me borrow your apple. I will pay 1$ to lend it for every week I have it. You agree. 
As soon as I get it, I sell it for $10. I now have money and no apples. One week later, the price of apples goes down to $5. I buy an apple at $5 and give you your apple back. I've made $4 profit (since I paid $1 to borrow it). I have shorted apples. I have made money on the price of apples going down.

If the price went up instead, and I was wrong, I lose money when I have to buy the apple back to give back to you.

&gt;What is a short squeeze?

If tons of people in my city are shorting apples, but the price actually goes up (I was wrong) they are in trouble! The price could technically keep rising and their risk is infinite.
Now if demand goes up, and people suddenly LOVE apples, those people that shorted get really really nervous. The higher it goes, the more it costs to buy back the apple (cover). 
When the first person that shorts breaks, and buys back apples, the demand raises, and the prices goes even higher!
Now suddenly shorters are racing for who can buy back first, making the price explode like a bomb.


&gt;What is stock manipulation?

People doing funky things with apples to wrongly give the illusion the apples are worth less. For example, they can lend out apples that they just borrowed from someone else, or say that there is a worm infestation when really there is not. Or they can close apple shops altogether, which would be really bad and illegal.

&gt;What is a hedge fund?

Its like an apple king in your city, they have a lot of apples and/or move a lot of apples, making a lot of money in doing so. They have a lot of power to influence the price of apples to their benefit.</text>

    <text>The company does.  When they first become public, kind of decide how many shares they sell. Each share is a percentage ownership of the company.   When you buy a stock, you’re giving them money in exchange for ownership in the stuff they own and profits they make.   Now most companies that even contemplate going public make lots of money (or potentially) and want lots of investors, so they can have more cash to do the things they do.   They cut up the company into shares of stock.   If they choose to sell only 5 shares of stock they can, but it would be really hard for someone to buy just one share.   And effectively they would be a business partner with 1/5 of a voice on the direction the company goes.  So it’s better to cut it up in millions of pieces.  Then sell half of them with the other half being controlled or owned by the founders of the company.  In the future they could issue more stock, but this basically means that everyone else’s stock will go down in value, because all stocks are percentages of a company..... if the company didn’t get bigger (more valuable) the stocks have to have less value.  Companies can also buyback stock basically buy stock from stock holders and giving them money for it... this they can either distribute how they please, or just delete those shares so that all the rest are worth a little more.     You could also split stocks, basically give everyone who owns a shares of stock an equal number of stocks.  This cuts the value of the stock exactly in half, by doubling the number of stocks that exist.</text>

    <text>If you have to ask this question, then you definitely shouldn't be trying anything advanced, like options. And you shouldn't take advice from strangers online about specific stocks to buy or sell. 

But if you just buy a stock, the most you can lose is the price you paid for it. So say you buy 1 stock of GameStop for $200. If it drops to $.01; you lost your money. If it raises, you can make money. Remember that the only time that you actually make(or lose) money is when you sell. 

So long story short: if you can afford to lose $200 (or $400, or $2000) and you think that the value will be higher when you are able to sell, then you would want to buy. 

Just be aware that you could lose whatever you invest. Don't ever gamble with your rent or food money, and also know that it can be addictive. If you are an adult with a relatively stable job and some extra money that you won't miss, it can make you some extra money, or at least be a fun way to lose a few hundred dollars. 

Good luck, and post your winnings/losses.</text>

    <text>100% of stock is a misnomer.  There is a certain percentage of stock that is *restricted* in a way that prevents it from being bought or sold normally.  Think stock benefits that take a year to "vest", the CEO's own stock where sales have to be scheduled in advance and so on.  The 140+% number that gets bandied about is the percentage of *tradeable* stock.

So how does it get past 100%?  There's two legal ways:

1. that restricted stock is only restricted for the CEO or employee or whatever to keep them from selling everything then dipping out of their contract or agreement.  That stock can be lent to someone else who isn't restricted, as long as its given back in time for the CEO or employee to vest and sell it themselves.  This doesn't even always happen by the employee themselves, many brokerages will just do it for you without even telling you.

2. If Shorty McShort borrows a share from Alice and sells it to Bob, then Shorty McShort borrows a share from Bob to sell to Charlie, that single share has been borrowed twice.  If that share was the only share that Shorty McShort is allowed to buy then 200% of the stock has been shorted.

The illegal option is the "Naked Short".  Instead of borrowing a share from someone you sell someone a share knowing that it takes a day or two for all of the electronic paperwork to get done and pray you manage to find a share cheaper in time for the paperwork to finish and buy and transfer that share instead.

Backing up to option #2.  With "short interest" at 200% if Charlie becomes aware of Shorty's situation he can make up completely imaginary numbers and Shorty McShort *must* pay him a goojillion dollars to get that share back so he can give it back to Bob.  Of course at this point Bob now knows how much Shorty McShort needs that share, so he demands pinky-to-lip *one meeeeelion dollars*.  This stage of the game is called the "short squeeze".

Meanwhile, Alice isn't lending him that share for free, he has to pay Alice every day he's borrowing the share.  If he cant cough up the goojillion and a meeelion dollars, the rent will eventually bankrupt him. And if Shorty McShort goes bankrupt without returning the share all the way back to Alice, he will likely lose his license and/or be banned from trading again, ending his career.

In the real world there's way more than one share of stock out there, and the majority of it is held in funds of various sizes who are more than happy to accept real numbers like $400 or $500, or in a lot of cases, limits like "$50 less than it was at the peak" (this is called a "stop loss" order, where you sell when it looks like the stock is going to fall) so while people talk about the theory being "infinite" the reality is that [VW ended up in this situation several years ago and hit $1000](https://www.autoweek.com/news/industry-news/a35340727/heres-how-the-gamestop-short-squeeze-is-like-the-vw-squeeze-of-2008/) before the people who were able to sell stock finally decided to cash out.

    <text>This is actually effecting the market far less than headlines might make it seem.  It is just such an extraordinary event that everyone is talking about it.  It is likely that there are multiple hedge funds that have already lost, or probably will lose, literally billions of dollars from shorting it.  It is also possible that hey *hedged* their positions and will lose a bit but not much at all.  There are also a bunch of retail investors including multiple on wsb that have made millions of dollars on it.</text>

    <text>So long as nobody sells there's nothing they can do except keep paying interest on the short, or pay whatever absurd prices the people holding shares dictate.

The key to all this is that, once 1 or 2% of the wsb buyers start selling, it can easily snowball into the price plummeting and losing all of it's value in a matter of hours</text>

    <text>Let's say you see a bike at a store with a price tag of $100. You get the feeling that the store is going to drop the price of the bike to $50. So you go to your friend Steve and say, "I'll sell you a bike for $100. Give me the money and I'll give you the bike tomorrow." Steve wants the bike so he gives you $100. The next day, as you guessed, the store lowers the bike's price to $50. You buy the bike from the store at the $50 price and give it to Steve. You just made $50! All is well. But you *had* to buy that bike because you'd already sold it to Steve; you would've been totally hosed if the store increased the price of the bike instead of lowering it.

This is what happened. The hedge fund people "sold" shares of Gamestop that they didn't actually own yet for a certain amount of money. They thought the shares were going to go down in value so they'd make a profit just like the bike scenario. They couldn't just buy other stock because they *had* to buy the Gamestop stock--they'd already sold it to a bunch of Steves.</text>

    <text>1. That piece was wrong. Most shorts don't expire it just costs money to keep them open. Depending on how they are set up, as price rises it may cost more money to keep them open.

2. Because you can use 1 stock to close multiple shorts the same way you can use one ten dollar bill to settle 200 dollars in debt. Ie. I pay my debt of 10$ to Suzie who uses that to pay her debt of 10$ to billy etc.
In this case Melvin buys a share at 148$ from Robin and uses that to close the short with me. I hold a day and sell into the market at 348$. Melvin buys the stock I just sold and uses it to close a position with Hood. Who then sells at 220, because the price is going down and they want to get what they can which Melvin buys and uses to cover their short with Cohen. 1 share, 3 positions covered. 

3. They expected gamestop's value to go to zero. If they'd been right they would have earned a lot of money as they wouldn't have had to return those borrowed stocks.

4. Because now it really is overvalued. No-one thinks GME will be worth 100$+ in a year meaning you can borrow it at 400 and, if you have enough money probably make 380 on that trade in a month.</text>

    <text>When people buy shares/stocks, they are giving the company money in exchange for that share. If the price of the stock goes down, it’s a loss for both sides usually. The company won’t be paid as much for shares, and the buyer won’t be able to sell for as much.</text>

    <text>Love your answer above, I'm somewhat knowledgeable about all of this but what I don't understand is the way puts are behaving. I could probably sit down and work it out (if I squint I can make a connection) but I'm sure I'll understand better if an expert can explain!

So for most stocks, the price of put contracts goes up when the stock price goes down, and the puts get cheaper when the price goes up. This is, I assume, because it's more likely your puts will be itm if the price is lower, so you're willing to pay more (and vice versa). For $GME, that's not how it's behaving. Is that because there are so many people who see the stock as overvalued, so demand is outstripping supply? Or does it have something to do with the possibly inability to exercise causing fewer people to offer the contracts? Does this affect the liquidity of the puts? Will they be harder (or easier) to sell before expiration if the squeezing continues?</text>

    <text>Just a small clarification. Gamestop’s CEO is unchanged, and still George Sherman. They did however welcome several new board members (including Ryan Cohen former CEO of Chewy), all high level execs from Chewy, a pet supply store that is mostly online. The excitement of a group of people familiar with the logistics of shifting a previously retail B&amp;M business model store type into primarily online excited the investors at WSB.</text>

    <text>1. it's public information. A lot of stuff regarding publicly traded companies must be public information, by law.  

2. No, actual shorts don't have expiry date, just the derivatives (i.e. puts). you can't buy more than 100% of stock, but you can give back more than 100% of stock provided you owe someone that much, so the people you're giving it back to may sell it on the market and you can buy it again and give it back again.  

3. Because they were trying to beat an already dead horse and considered it a safe bet. A classic mistake of equating low returns = low risk.  

4. If they realized their loses even at the start of the rise they would have to shut the entire fund down, which means no more paychecks from all the sweet fees they collect and on to job hunting. And since they don't gamble on their own money it's "double down time!"</text>

    <text>In addition to what the others have answered; the Game Stop Corporation (GSE) stock affects the entire market because the hedge funds that "short" GSE will *have* to deliver those stocks back, and there are penalties for not managing to do so by the time limit.

To cover these penalties and what I've understood is called *margin* (you have to have so and so much money compared to the stock price available in an account to be able to keep the short) they might need to sell off other stocks, which in turn has an effect on the rest of the market.

That is as far as I've understood it, there might be some errors. Hopefully someone smarter than me will correct them if so.</text>

    <text>The person who owns the stock originally is usually holding a long position, so their bet is that the price will rise. If someone came up to you and asked you to lend them stock because they want to short, and you were betting long, then basically there’s no downside to you doing it if you’re confident they’re wrong. They have to return the stock no matter what. They also can charge interest to the borrower

There’s also another way of shorting called a “put” which is a bit more complicated

What stops me from placing a bid for $200 (other than it being nonsensical, but then again this is why we're here)? Is there any regulation on that? Am I basically allowed to manually input my bid or asking price? Cause if so, that would explain the mechanism.</text>

    <text>A person with private inside information the the general public does not have access to then uses that information to either buy undervalued stock which will soon increase in value or sell stock that will soon decrease in value due to inside factors that have yet to be disclosed. It’s bad because it allows people an advantage over others that makes the market inequitable.

For example if you or a friend/family member work at a pharma company producing a vaccine for coronavirus and you are privy to the knowledge that the vaccine is successful in the days before the information is released to the public and then you use that information to buy a ton of shares in the company to profit, that’s insider trading.</text>

    <text>You’re correct, upwards of $70 billion in losses have been realized, but unlike the 2008 financial crisis this is localized purely to firms that short stock, or bet against a company’s success. These are mainly hedge funds and your typical Wall St elite that drain dying companies like Gamestock (GME) by betting against the share price. Reddit got wind and had MASSIVE buy ins  across the world to double/triple/quadruple GME’s share price, costing the Hedge funds billions. The Hedge fund Melvin’s got the biggest losses that I know of, but there may be bigger losers now</text>

    <text>I would say no. The percentage of money shorting these stocks, compared to those who support the people holding GME is small. Furthermore, shorting a stock reduces its value and only serves to bring share prices DOWN; bringing attention to the negatives OF SHORTING, such as the risks and market manipulation effect, and destroying the companies who make billions off this bad behavior is beneficial for the entire market.</text>

    <text>I'm guessing this won't be a popular comment and I understand that, especially because from what I understand hedge fund investors and redditors are now playing the same game, so fair enough. But according to this site, to invest in a hedge fund: 
"You must have a net worth of $1,000,000 or have made over $200,000 ($300,000 for married couples) for the last two years and this year as well." Having a net worth of $1 million doesn't make you ultra wealthy. https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/011915/can-you-invest-hedge-funds.asp</text>

They are contractually required to return it, but now it costs way more than they were expecting, and don't want to pay that much to buy it back so they can return it, but also have to return it, so they're in a bit of a bind.</text>

Do you need tk worry?
Depends what the government does. If gme skyrockets and the government does nothing you'll be fine. The firms go bankrupt thats it. The problem is when the govt bails out 70+ billion debt



To go into more detail
The firms( melvin and family) go bankrupt the debt gets passed to the brokers, the brokers cant handle the debt so they go bankrupt and that lands on the banks. And they won't want to pay that so they try to get a bailout.

The real number is something like they bought 2 billion $ shares on a loan when theres only 300 million worth of shares at the time. And now have to pay 70 billion plus</text>

    <text>Most people don't have access to pre/after market, a few brokers allow it. If you're buying at market open you don't know what the opening price will be, if you set a market order then it'll buy at whatever price it is at opening or you could wait to see what the price is and buy yourself.</text>

    <text>No. For example GME was a $1B valued company and now it’s like $25B. The SPY etf tracks the top 500 largest companies which have a collective market value of $33,400B.

This is a tiny blip on the radar.

GameStop isn’t even a mid-cap stock let alone a staple large cap.

This isn’t that much in the scheme of things. Sure a few hedge funds will blow up but it’s like squashing an ant, not much changes in the world.</text>

    <text>You're kinda on the money however they're usually a connection between the profitability and groth vs the stock because stock pays dividend so stock price decreasing means the hedge funds don't think you're going to do will in the next "x- time frame" however when stocks are high business have the opportunity to sell a few shares they hold for further investment or to solve liquidity issues the downside of the downs is this sale of shares becaumes much more costly proportionately speaking.</text>

    <text>They can't just stay in the short position forever, because they have to pay interest on the short position, and because whoever lent them the share can basically force them to close their position if they don't have enough capital to cover it.  This is why the hedge funds with short positions have been trying to get cash injections, so they can hold out long enough that they can avoid the short squeeze and the price can decline, allowing them to unwind their position.

But of course now people know the price has to go down eventually (since the share price has nothing to do with Gamestop as a business, and everything to do with complex entangled financial instruments), so while some firms are trying to limit their losses, others are shorting more shares.</text>

    <text>It's essentially a bet. If you're shorting, that means your betting against the brokerage that's letting you borrow the stock that it will drop in price, allowing you to buy back at a lower price and return it to the lender (brokerage). The brokerage is betting it goes up and the person shorting owe's them stock that's worth more than when the shorter borrowed it. The lender can then theoretically turn around and sell it for a profit.

Why do lender(brokerage) want people to do this?
Because shorting is riskier than going long on a stock, theoretically, there is no limit to the amount you could lose. Same reason casinos allow people to gamble, the odds are in thier favor.</text>

    <text>Basically, if you want to join in this historical hedge fund ass fucking, buy in what you can afford to lose and hold until the hedge funders have to buy at astronomical prices. The crazy part is that this has turn from seeing an opportunity to make money on top of screwing these hedge funds in WSB, into some sort of organic grassroot revolt by common people. 

This is probably the closest thing you can do as an actual revolt to hurt the assholes who most deserved it, in a virulently rigged capitalism. This case is not likely to happen again.</text>

    <text>The one who loans the stock to the short seller gets a "rental fee" from the short seller, as long as they have not yet returned it. It costs the loaner nothing, except in so far as they cannot sell the stock until the short seller gives it back. 

They can force the short seller to give it back, though, which is what a "short squeeze" is. The shorts all have to buy back the stocks they borrowed, regardless of the current price, because the loaner is forcing them to return the loaned stock, which they don't actually own at the moment.</text>

    <text>Not sure if someone else has clarified but something to keep in mind:

When you short a stock, you're doing it on a loan. As the price of the stock increases, your broker will keep track of how much you might potentially owe if you closed your position at the current price. Your broker will assign an amount that they think you can pay back and will allow you to hold on to your short position until you hit that amount. If the price keeps going up, you'll either be required to close out your position so you don't end up in anymore potential debt (this is known as a margin call). Or you'll be required to add cash to your account to show your broker that you're good for an additional amount of money.

If the stock price keeps going up, at some point, these hedge funds are going to get margin called and will be forced to close out their position and therefore buy back all of the shares they shorted. Forcing the price even higher. So you can't just sit on these shorts indefinitely because you're expecting it to go down.</text>

One day he comes up to me and says "a terrible thing happened at work today the company is going to lose millions, sell your shares". I of course sell all my shares at $60 per share. Next day the news comes out about the terrible thing. The price falls to $30. I didn't lose half of my portfolio because I had an advantage other people didn't have simply because I knew the right person. That is insider trading.</text>

    <text>&gt;  and if everyone holds and holds and holds, itll only keep going up and up?

Almost. Hedge funds need to BUY more GME stocks to cover their shorts, and so long as small retail investors (like WSB) continue to hold their stocks, the number of stocks available for hedge funds to buy are reduced, there simply isnt enough supply. GameStop could release more stocks, but that would only help the hedge funds who are trying to run them to bankruptcy.

This is why they got RobinHood to stop buying GME (but not selling), they wanted to drive down the price (which they did), and create a panic sell off so hedge funds could buy the stocks to cover their short (which didnt happen, since WSB are holding the line!!)

The stock price will continue to fluctuate in the next few days, but so long as WSB and other small investors continue to hold, the hedge funds will be screwed.</text>

    <text>It largely depends on how they did it as there are multiple ways to make this bet. If you do it the way I described, you don’t have a deadline per se, but the people who lent you the shares might get nervous that the price is getting too high and will want their shares back and basically force you to buy them.

EDIT: When you borrow shares like this, you have to post collateral. As the price of GME keeps going up, you will have to put up more and more collateral. Eventually if the prices gets too high, the people who lend out the GME shares will want their shares back and either make you buy them or take your collateral.</text>

    <text>Not really. Wall Street has to buy back all the stock they shorted. If they fail to, they will be in violation of the law. If the stock is worth more than they sold it for, they lost money. Parts of Wall Street may be in on the squeeze, but for the people who shorted, they have to buy the GameStop stock back for whatever price they can, which means paying out of pocket for the difference.</text>

    <text>Someone will correct me if I'm wrong, but no, there is no deadline.

HOWEVER, there is something called a 'margin maintenance requirement' that you must have in your account in order to short shares.

When you first establish a short-selling position, you need to have 150% of the value in a separate margin account.

So for simplicity, suppose you short 1 share of company X at $10.  You'll need to have 150% * $10 = $15 in your margin account - $10 from the sale of your 'borrowed' share, along with $5 you must put up.

After this, if the stock goes up, you must have at least 125% (some brokerages require up to 140%) of the value of the stock in that margin account at all times.

So suppose the $10 stock shoots up to $20.  Well, now you'll need 125% * $20 = $25 in your margin account.  It currently only has $15 in it, so your brokerage is going to come to you and demand the extra $10 (known as a 'margin call').  If you're unable to come up with these extra funds, your brokerage will liquidate your other holdings to come up with that $10.  Either that, or you can buy back the share that you borrowed (which is now at $20) and close out your position.

And this is why while you could in theory wait until the stock went down, with the prices shooting up as high as they have been, the margin maintenance requirement will become so large that it would be virtually impossible.

EDIT:  some clarifications</text>

    <text>The thing is, their shorts were bought way back when the stock was very very cheap (I don't know the numbers, but probably around 5-20). So it would need to drop to below those levels for them to even start getting close to breaking even on those shorts. Thing is by that time we'll all have made off with the money that they had to pay us for stocks they didn't want in the first place. 

The beauty of it all is there are always winners and losers in the market. Most of the time if you win, your neighbor is losing. In this case, if you're winning, millionaires and billionaires (those with accounts managed by the hedge funds) are losing.</text>

    <text>I wasn’t referring to the after-hour trading as manipulation but rather the act of blocking purchase orders during the day by brokerages which drove the price down by cutting demands. If what you said is true, it allows after-hour trader to buy stocks cheap after hours and sell during the day once the demand from the general public is back (e.g. individual investors move to another brokerage firm, purchase ban lifted, etc.)</text>

    <text>If you are long a stock and will hold it regardless, the fees paid to you by short sellers to borrow your stock will increase your investment returns. 

Think about Blackrock - they're an index investor, they will own a stock in a certain amount regardless of the price or long term prospects as long as it is in the index. Given they don't care about the stock, the stock price, or the fundamentals of the company, getting additional fees from lending stock is free money.</text>

    <text>Not necessarily, definitely some people will hold too long. But more than 100% of the total shares are shorted (this data may or may not be up to date but it does definitely seem to be a really large percentage). It’s expected to take days for the shorters to buy all the shares they need. That’s a lot of time for people to sell.</text>

    <text>Hi, I have a bachelor's in mathematics. I am equipped to understand all this (and do, mostly).

This is a fantastic example of our economy being too complicated for the average person to understand. I'm not saying this is crazy difficult, but it is, I think, just enough jargon to scare your average Joe.

I don't know my point, but I don't think it needs to be this difficult. All of what is happening now is really making me consider what is potable to your average person. People are way smarter than they're given credit for.</text>

    <text>So I've had a question for the past few days on this, maybe you can answer it for me. 

If companies A B and C lose a ton of money on this with capital that they do not have, how will they pay out to the people making the money off of the gamestop stock?

Is there a system in place to ensure that people will get paid if they cash out stocks when the companies who invested do not have money?</text>

    <text>Borrow the share, sell it and borrow it again to sell it. The borrowed stock you sold at the market isn't tagged as "borrowed" or something.

Imagine a fruit market with exactly 5 apples. 2 people are holding 1 apple each and won't sell them, no matter what. That makes it 3 apples available at the market (that's the float). Now 3 people (let's call them Timmys) buy 1 apple each and borrow them to someone (let's call him Gabriel), who wants to short apples. He promises, he will give the apples back to the Timmys in the future and sell the apples at the market again. So that is 3 apples that are shorted. Jessica buys the apples at the market from Gabriel. Now Andrew comes to the market and believes, just like Gabriel, apples won't hold their value, so he is looking to short. He asks Jessica, the same thing, that Gabriel asked the Timmys. Jessica borrows the apples to Andrew, who sells them at the market. Now 6 apples are shorted, though there are only 5. 

I hope that helps a bit. If you have question, don't hesitate.</text>

    <text>When something in the stock market suddenly changes like what happened with GameStop, how is it actually possible to keep up with the stocks and recover? Doesn’t the stock market move all the time every day (i.e. way too fast for someone to adequately recover)? 

And jumping from the latter question, is this why the stereotypical depiction of Wall Street people in films has them as a “live fast, die young” mentality, or as extremely devastated and depressed when situations like this happen?</text>

    <text>&gt;How can you borrow a share that doesn't exist

you technically can't. the process is called 'naked shorting' and it's illegal. 

but the way it works is the same as regular shorting, except in a naked short the seller of the share never checks to see if it's available. it's like a cashier selling you a book in a shop when the computer says they have 9 in stock, but not checking to see if the other 9 counters have sold the remaining copies.</text>

    <text>Illegally by naked short selling. Melvin Capital has 4 prime brokers. It can borrow 100 shares. Then it can ask all of its 4 brokers simultaneously to short 100 shares. It can reassure the brokers it can cover these shares by showing its ownership of 100 shares. So, it can 'borrow' 400 shares while only having capacity to cover 100. The brokers won't be able to catch it since they work independently and don't know what Melvin does with other brokers.</text>

I could understand fundamentally if Bob expected the price to go up why he might lend (basically playing the bet in the opposite direction) but other than that... why? Like with gamestop particularly, I doubt there were that many "Bob's" out there expeting the stock to go up right?

Also, how do these funds even find the lenders. Like are "Bob's" specific people who have expressed interest in lending? Is Bob even a person?</text>

    <text>Yes.

As an organization, if WSB, Inc. was a corporation, their strategy would be a losing one.

But they are not an organization, they are a collective of individuals. And some of these individuals have made A LOT of money from this “stock market flash mob”, and the rest are simply willing to part ways with their $100 to see these other people prosper in exchange for running a hedge fund out of business.

EDIT: to clarify on [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/l7ckr5/eli5_stock_market_megathread/gl7t1u7/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3) comment, I am talking about what happens *after* Melvin either settles the short squeeze or get liquidated.

    <text>The benifits is the hedge fund pays a fee no matter what.
If the price drops the hedge fund makes money and the institution gets to keep the fee while selling the stock at a price they were originally happy with.

If the price doesn't drop the hedge fund loses the fee. The institution still gets the fee.

That is how options work and I think it is the same here.</text>

    <text>If I owned stock in something that was failing, what would motivate me to let someone else sell it and make money on it and give me back my stock when it's worthless? I guess what I'm asking is, why does short selling even exist when it doesn't seem to benefit the actual owner of the stock?


edit: I gather that the stock's owner gets paid a bit for the use of their stock. But that just raises a further question. If the short seller can make so much money that they can both pay these fees and make a profit, just by selling this stock right now at its current price, why wouldn't the stock's actual owner just sell it themselves and keep all that money for themselves?</text>

    <text>I'm a finance lawyer with experience in securities lending.

There is a critical point here which everyone seems to be missing, particularly the WSB investors: when the big squeeze happens, the short sellers may not actually be forced to buy GME shares. I will now explain why.

A key principle of securities lending is that it is collateralised. This means that the person who borrows the securities in order to short sell them has to leave a cash deposit with the lender in case they don't end up returning the shares for whatever reason. The size of the cash deposit is equal to the value of the shares. This is sort of like leaving your credit card number with a car hire company - if you don't return the car, they're going to charge you for it. However, unlike a car, the value of the borrowed shares can rapidly increase, making the original cash deposit insufficient. As a result, the borrower has to top up the cash deposit each morning if the share price rose the previous day. Conversely, if the share price falls, the lender has to return part of the cash deposit to the borrower. The idea is that the cash deposit should always have the same value as the shares.

To take an example, if I borrow 10 GME shares when the price is $10, I have to leave behind a deposit of $100 in cash with the lender. If the next day the share price rises and closes at $15, the following morning I have to transfer an additional $50 in cash to the lender so that the cash deposit is still equal to the value of the shares.

If the borrower does not return the securities, or ever fails to top up the cash deposit when required to do so, the lender can immediately terminate the loan and keep the cash deposit instead of getting the shares back. This basically makes the loan risk-free for the lender.

Why is this important? Well, we can assume that the hedge funds are currently having to provide enormous amounts of cash deposits to cover any securities loans which they took out in order to make their short sale. If WSB pushes the price high enough, the hedge funds will run out of cash. At that point, the securities lenders will close out the loans and keep the cash deposits. The hedge funds will be bankrupt, but their money will not go to the WSB investors - rather it will go to the securities lenders. And, as soon as the short positions are closed out, the GME price will likely nosedive, leaving the WSB investors who are still holding shares penniless. So, while they may succeed at destroying the hedge funds, it may be a pyrrhic victory.</text>

    <text>Because if the price **doesn't** go down, you get to buy back a stock at a price less than what it's worth.

What happened now was that Hedge Funds promised that they would sell back the stocks for, say, 20$.

But the price skyrocketed to 320$, so when it was time to sell back the stocks, the hedge funds had to buy stocks for 320 and sell them for 20, at a 300$ loss per stock.</text>

    <text>What is the end goal for WSB? I understand that they want to make money. But when they keep saying buy and hold, if everyone buys it now and sits on it then won't the bubble burst and everyone who bought it will lose money. Are they purposefully sacrificing money just to stick it to hedge funds now or are they trying to make money in a way I'm not understanding?</text>

    <text>I feel like the key thing about the short-squeeze isn't that the retail investors have all piled in on it - yes, that has driven the price up and left the shorts in a bad spot, but the **squeeze** part is different.

I'll have a go:

A short-squeeze is actually a very simple supply/demand chain reaction. Essentially it's a frantic rush for the lifeboats on the Titanic, and no one wants to be the ones left behind.

Basic concepts:  
1) More buyers than sellers, price goes up  
2) More sellers than buyers, price goes down  
3) The more shares of something there are on the market, the more stable the price is.  

When you're in a short position, if the price is still dropping as a company is struggling (which is what the shorts are betting on) then you have plenty of   time to gradually buy the shares from the investors who are offloading their position.

HOWEVER. If the price suddenly defies expectations and *increases* significantly, this causes a problem. All of the short sellers are now potentially looking at a loss. As the price increases, the shorts have a choice.

1) buy the shares now at a loss  
2) wait for the price to go down  

Option 1 tanks a loss but protects you from *further* losses if the price continues to climb. Option 2 potentially means you can still make a profit if it's a short term spike, but if the price keeps increasing, your losses increase. 

Using OP's example:  
Market price is $20, person enters a short contract. If the price increases to $25, they can either 'cover' their position at $25 and take a $5/share loss, or they can hope it drops below $20 again. However if the share price keeps climbing to $30, $40, $50, the person who waited out (option 2) keeps taking bigger and bigger losses per share.

**Now, the squeeze:**  
If a stock's price goes up, it means that there was slightly more demand than supply, hence the price increasing. Importantly, *any short seller taking option 1's approach generates further buy pressure on the stock*. And if, for example, 50% of a stock's total shares are in short contracts, that is potentially a demand for half the shares in existence all at the same time. That is a *huge* amount of buying pressure. It starts a chain reaction - the first shorts get spooked and buy shares to cover themselves, which raises the price, which causes more shorts to rush to buy stock and cover their position, which drives the price higher and higher and higher. This is a short-squeeze. And the higher the short interest, the bigger this chain reaction will be.

GameStop had, at one point, 140% short interest. There was more shares contracted in shorts than there are in existence. Retail investors noticed this and started pouring in, knowing that by buying and holding the shares it would both raise the price (potentially triggering a squeeze) *and* lessen the number of available shares on the market (increasing the severity of said squeeze), drive the price up, and eventually the shorts would have to try and cover themselves at utterly ludicrous prices.</text>

    <text>The way WSB is winning because there is are a lot more shares there are shorted, than there are shares available. 

If we say there are 100 shares available, then the hedgefonds have shorted 140 shares. So more shares than there a available

If we say u own all of the shares 100, then u could basically just set the price yourself and if they think it is too expensive and wouldn’t buy to the price u have set, then they would end up with massive financial trouble because they pay a fee every week until the close out there position.

    <text>In the movie “The Big Short,” the people who shorted the housing market were portrayed as protagonists. Since learning more about GameStop’s situation, I’m just learning now that people who short are not good people. Can someone explain how one was seen as good and the other as bad?</text>

    <text>Why would someone “lend” their shares to a hedge fund? Wouldn’t that be an indication to Bob that the price will go down?

Why wouldn’t Bob just sell at $10 instead of lending his shares to get them back at $5? I assume that there is a fee involved, but I can’t make out what would make this worth it.</text>

    <text>OK, I think I'm getting this. But I'm still confused as to why you can have more shares on loan than you have available.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me take a small guess though:

Continuing with your example of 100 Gamestop shares let's say that Billy borrows 70 shares and thus there are **70 shares on loan**. Then let's say that Bob comes in and borrows 55 shares from Billy. Thus there are now **125 shares on loan**.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I getting it right?</text>

    <text>The short sellers have contracts where they need to buy the shares back to return them to the entity they borrowed them off. If they don't, they pay interest and lose money. This much is clear.

When they attempt to buy shares to fulfil their contracts, this drives the price up.

By no means an expert, but this is my ELI5 attempt. 

Normally this wouldn't be an issue, as you say, but in this example, the shorters have shorted shares equivalent to 250% of the total shares available. So in order to fulfill their contracts they need to buy every share available on the market 2.5 times.

You can see how if a large group of people refused to sell, this would make the stock available to buy so much smaller, so when the hedge fund attempts to buy lots and lots of shares in order to close their contracts, the price could skyrocket.

This is the goal of WallSteetBets. Once the price skyrockets, they sell and make a huge profit, and the hedge fund probably goes bankrupt.

Happy to discuss further.</text>

I have a feeling there's going to be a bailout with what's happening with the GME situation. The little guys getting into investing and getting screwed over again and again. What happens if we've had enough. Give the cash to the government's but have the everyday person transact In digital currency.</text>

    <text>My family member lost about $8000 today on her investments (which are all considered low risk), is this due to temporary destabilization that will go back to normal in a few weeks, or a more permanent serious issue? It's really scaring her because we're not rich nor do we have fun money to be flippant with, it's her retirement fund and if it gets a lot worse she might be in trouble. I want to be able to reassure her but I don't understand this and she doesn't want to pester her financial advisor who is probably super busy right now.

As someone with a reasonable amount of knowledge on the subject, I am able to spot when someone is misusing industry terms or has just read a few pages on investopedia and thinks this makes them an expert on the financial industry.

    <text>as for the current situation

A squirrel gets a nut then another squirrel gets a nut, after watching more squirrels join to collect nuts. 

A merchant walks buy thinking "hehe stupid squirrel" thinks that, When squirrel collects lots of nuts they will become worthless in squirrel's eyes.

Just like one hair band is useful but hundred hair bands are worthless.

"hey squirrel want a nut" he borrows a nut from a seller from a shop ("i will give you back because i know nuts are cheap and worthless ") and sells the nut to the squirrel for 100 dollar. squirrel buys the nut and goes away, but merchant promised the seller to give back the nut. 

He goes back to squirrel can i buy a nut for 50 bucks,you have so many. Squirrel says no, 100 no, 200 no, "fuck you" i am not selling my nuts they are mine. 

Merchant is unhappy and makes a rule no one collects nuts only give back nuts, but squirrel says fuck off.

    <text>Admittedly, I do not have a very sophisticated understanding of this whole GameStop stock shorting situation, but if making a ton of money on the stock market is as simple as finding a stock that has been extremely shorted by hedge funds, and then getting thousands of people to put their money into it, how come this hasn’t been done earlier?  The internet has been around for decades and even r/wallstreetbets has been around for years. Why is this idea taking off now when it seems like a simple enough premise?  Am I missing something here?</text>

Stocks may not seem like a tangible thing, but they kinda are. They are literally a percentages of a company. If you owed someone 3% of Google, you have to give them back the full 3% of Google that you done sold. You can't just give them back the same 0.1% 30 times.</text>

    <text>Ok, here is my question: you said you issued 1 million oranges. They are now owned by a certain number of people. If someone else wants an orange or part of one do they have to buy it from one of the orange owners? Like does someone have to be willing to sell the orange for a new person to buy it?

Maybe it’s a dumb question but I’m trying to figure out how stocks, which are like an imaginary value in my mind, have a quantity and how that shifts in “ownership”</text>

    <text>The problem being, they shorted 140% of the existing shares, there aren't enough shares in circulation to close their positions. What with people buying and holding also, there's even less.</text>

    <text>Quick ELI5 on what "Short Selling" is:

Imagine you want to buy a car. You agree with a seller and write a contract to buy the car for $10 000 **no matter what**.

Now two things could happen:

1. While driving to the delivery point, the seller gets into a car crash and totals the car, making it worth $1000. But you're still under contract to buy the car **no matter what**, so you're paying $10 000 for a car worth 1000.
2. While driving to the delivery, the seller is pulled over by a car enthusiast who says "holy shit, this car is amazing. I will pay 100 000 for it!" But the seller has made a contract to sell it for 10 000 to you, **no matter what**.

When a trader "short sells" he's betting that the car will crash, and so he offers to pay sell you a car for $5000. Which would be a great deal for a $10 000 car, but a terrible deal for a $1000 wreckage. The trader wins if the car crashes.

Inversely, a trader can bet the opposite, that the car is actually worth a shit-ton more, and offer to pay $50 000 for it. Also a great deal for someone selling a car for $10 000, but a terrible deal if it's actually worth $100 000. The trader wins if the car enthusiast pays 100k for the car.

What happened was that the hedge funds bet GME would crash and only be worth like 20$, so they wrote a contract to sell it for that. Reddit and casual traders decided that the GME stock is actually solid gold, and drove up the price to $300+. So now hedge funds are contractually obligated to sell a stock worth $300, for $20.</text>

    <text>So, explain to me like I'm five this question:

I'm glad the hedge funds got screwed at their own game, but who ends up profiting from creating this hype to buy Gamestop shares?

Not the person who buys today at a ridiculously inflated price. This seems a lot like bitcoin -overhyped crowd-sourcing of investors, many of whom lose out by joining the rollercoaster at the wrong time. It seems like there is a crew of cynical profiteers who're not really that different from the hedge fund guys, because somebody is going to lose their shirt when this show is over.</text>

    <text>The part I don't understand is why would I loan you the oranges if they are going to go down in value? You agree to give me $2 plus my 100 oranges back, but yesterday it was worth $102 and today it's worth $52. Why would I make that trade? Or am I also making a calculated gamble in this case just like the short seller?</text>

    <text>i think that is what they did today, but it requires capital and they are running out of it. The goal is to create an illusion that there is a massive sell off and it would really help them if others would also sell at a lower price. That is the power of holding shares. If they want to do drive the price down, they would need to do the process you mentioned over and over again.</text>

    <text>Late fees aren't a thing, it's not a library. The borrower pays a fee regularly for the privilege of borrowing the stock. For a liquid stock I think it's usually something like 5 basis points, or 0.05%. That's it, no deadlines, no late charges, as long as they can meet margin and don't get recalled.</text>

    <text>&gt; If a hedge fund has short sold 1000 shares, why can't they just buy one, return it, then buy it back, return it again, and repeat 1000x?

They absolutely can.  But when they return the stock to the lender, that doesn't automatically make it available for sale.  The lender can do whatever the hell they want, like hold on to it, or offer to sell it again for 10x the current price.

&gt; In the same vein, if two hedge funds have to return 1000 shares tomorrow, why can't one buy 1000 shares, return them, then the other buy those same shares and return them?

Same deal as before.</text>

    <text>It's not necessarily due to leverage. 

A owns the stock. A lends it to B who sell it to person C. C then lends it to D who sells it to E. Now E owns the stock and both A and C are owed stock. The company is shorted 200%.

There is also naked shorting and other exotic options but this is not necessary to end up with a market where more than 100% of the market has been shorted.</text>

    <text>Why are shortsellers buying back the shares at the inflated price right now, as there is a chance the price will drop long term? (once the storm has passed?)  


My understanding of shortselling is: you lend a share, you sell it immediately, and you need to return it (buy it back) sometime in the future. Say you shorted the gamestop stock in december 2020, and you need to return it this summer (2021): why would you buy it now as a shorter? Sure, you could reason: by the summer the share price would even be higher, so I will limit my losses by buying back now. But why don't the shortsellers take the risk that the price will "even out", and go back to their original december level?</text>

    <text> I'm genuinely curious about a few things given the recent GME news

1. If a hedge fund or some other financial entity (I know so few technical terms) where to rally fellow institutions to all buy a single stock, would it be seen as illegal market manipulation? 

1. Assuming the above is market manipulation, would it still be illegal market manipulation if they instead, went on the news or went to reddit to advertise a competitors short position to short squeeze? 

I guess my question here is:

&gt; would it have been illegal for a financial institution to do what wsb did? Or is the only distinction (and reason why it isn't illegal) being wsb actions being taken entirely by private citizens? 


Note I am not asking what is moral, etc I just want to understand why institutions are so butt hurt over the situation

Are they upset because they would get put in jail for pulling the same kind of stint?

Or are they genuinely upset purely because the public organised in a way that's perfectly legal that they couldnt replicate even if they were not in breach of regulations?</text>

    <text>This. The SEC kept shoring legal when they were formed because investors can root out shitty business faster than regulatory overview ever could. Definitely wouldn't hurt to cap it as a percent of a stocks float though. Or create a scaling interest for loaned shares based on percent of float to create a flexible soft cap.</text>

    <text>&gt;Share price, combined with number of total shares, determine the market cap of the company. You are only looking at the price- companies that get too large usually do a stock split to make shares more affordable while simultaneously increasing the number of shares by the split ratio

Thanks for the prompt response. This is interesting.

    <text>&gt;It has very little to do with the actual value of the corp, it's about the *perceived* value and perceived *future* value. If a bunch of people think the company is worth more than it is, or will be worth much more than it is, then people will buy the stocks.

Yeah but that still doesn't make sense. There's no way anybody thinks WWE has more perceived value and future value potential than AT&amp;T.</text>

    <text>Thanks, that helps a lot. After reading quite a bit today, this wraps it up simple, short and clear. 


So, how many redditors have just become millionaires?
And why didn’t the irresponsible short-sellers who will have to buy it all back not jump in to buy back their own shares before the prices went so high?
And what happens if the price suddenly falls back down? How would the redditors who currently own these shares know not to accidentally still hold them too long and end up with a loss?</text>

    <text>If the hedge fund files for bankruptcy in the event they can't cover their positions, technically they would be out of the picture now, correct? 

&amp; If they are out, is that stock essentially worth less now? Will its price fall back down to where it began?</text>

    <text>this particular situation is far more of a normal squeeze, because float percentage is at 250%, and is being shorted as of yesterday at 120% of number of available shares. if GME doesn't go below $20 in the next few weeks, then an infinite squeeze will occur and they will be forced to buy every single share that exists in the hands of every single shareholder or continue to pay interest indefinitely. in short: the only way out for these hedge funds is to break the law</text>

    <text>&gt;To me it just feels weird to make money on something that loses its value. Mostly because it’s SO far disconnected from the initial ‘a share is an investment in a company, a tiny bit of co-ownership’ idea of stock trading that it just feels like gambling, but gambling with things that affect real people’s lives potentially in very harsh ways.

That's a very true chain of thought. From what I've seen these few days, the co-ownership aspect is just largely ignored on the stock market.</text>

    <text>My understanding of this is that people are exploiting (legally mind you) the concept of buying insurance. Wasnt the initial purpose of hedging to protect yourself if a stock price goes down, but then it turned into "betting" or "wanting" it to decline so that you can get that lovely insurance payout?

    <text>Melvin is in 5th grade.

He goes to a school where kids sell different kinds of candy to each other on the playground.

Melvin is friends with an older, bigger kid named Essie-C. He makes sure that all the candy sales on the playground happen fairly. If a kid doesn't pay for the right price for the candy, or if the kid selling the candy just takes the money, Essie-C beats them up. Teachers at the school let this all happen because the kids like candy, they are better behaved when they have it, and Essie-C is generally a pretty trustworthy kid who is feared by the bad kids.

A delicious new candy called Chee'umee has come out, but it's only available in Japan. It's the perfect candy in every way, EXCEPT that many of the batches spoil very easily. The candy is so good though, that people still buy it, even with the possibility that they might end up with spoiled batch. Normally the wrapper of the candy is bright metallic green, but when it spoils, it turns black.

Melvin is friends with Essie-C. One day, Melvin has an idea and pulls Essie-C aside.

Melvin: Hey Essie-C! Have you heard about this new Japanese candy called Chee'umee?

Essie-C: Nope.

Melvin: Well, it's really good and I want to sell it to the kids on the playground, but I don't have any with me. My dad is going on a business trip to Japan next month, and he can bring some back for me. Would it be cool if I sell the other kids IOUs? Then when I get the candy, They can exchange their IOUs for the candy!

Essie-C: OK

Melvin: Well, there's one more thing. The Chee'umee might spoil before the kids get to exchange the IOUs for it. If that happens, is it okay if I keep the money they paid for the IOU? The kids I'm selling to will need to understand that we might get a spoiled batch and their IOUs won't be worth anything.

Essie-C: Sure. But you'd still have to give them the spoiled candy, if they want it.

Melvin: No kid would want the spoiled candy!

Essie-C: Them's the rules.

Melvin: Fine...

On the playground, Melvin follows this plan and sells 140 IOUs, which are little slips of paper to all the kids on the playground. He makes a lot of money that day.

Later that evening, Melvin talks to his dad, Sid Atell, at dinner. Melvin: Dad, when you go to Japan, do you think you could bring back some of that Chee'umee candy?

Sid: Sure, son! How much do you need?

Melvin: Well, I was hoping for... 140 pieces?

Sid: Goodness, son! That's a lot! I don't think I can bring that much back. I can bring back, oh about 20 pieces. Would that be okay?

Melvin: Sure I guess. Here's the money for the 20 pieces.

Melvin figures he will just tell the 120 kids that their candy got spoiled on the trip back from Japan. But this is great for Melvin, because he only had to pay his dad for 20 pieces of Chee'umee!

A month later, his dad returns from his trip to Japan with 20 pieces of candy, and all but 5 turned black. Melvin takes all the candy to the playground and exchanges all 5 of the shiny green metallic candies for IOUs. The 5 kids who got the green candies are excited and the candy is as delicious as advertised. The other kids are quite annoyed that so much of the candy spoiled. 

3 kids, Wally, Sam and Betty, are a little suspicious of Melvin, so they ask for their candies anyway. Melvin hands it over.

Wally, Sam and Betty open the candy and eat it. To their amazement, the candy is just as good! Better, even! The wrapper just turned black, but the candy itself is just fine! Wally, Sam and Betty tell all the kids on the playground to use their IOUs and get the candy even if it's in a black wrapper.

Melvin is now in a tough spot. He goes to Essie-C for help, but Essie-C reminds him of the deal. All IOUs have to be exchanged, if the kid wants their black-wrapped candy.

As a last ditch effort, Melvin goes to the playground teacher, Mrs. Robin Hood to tell her of his predicament. All these kids have IOUs and they really want the candy, but he can't give it to them.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Holy cow thanks everybody for the awards.

    <text>You dont think that making the stock  inflation more "real" could encourage other investors? My thought was that making making some of the growth look less like a "bubble" would encourage outside investors. Potentially even other hedge fund managers as opposed to just redditors. I could easily be wrong though, but I think there's value in making some of the growth real.</text>

    <text>Stocks markets are secondary markets meaning the trades that are occurring have nothing to do with the company itself. They are securities being traded by third parties.

The only negative way the stock price affects the company itself is if they need to raise capital and were looking to issue another public offering of stock, because the market price for the stock would have been ranked.

Executive in the company, on the other hand, often own stock and their net worth is obviously impacted by a moving stock price.

Edit: Ugh - this was supposed to be a response to someone who had misunderstood the fundamental reality of stock markets...oh well, the amount I care to correct them has been depleted now</text>

    <text>Well, is it that bad, though?  So, an entity loans ten million shares at $10/share to Melvin.  $100M.  Then the price goes to $500/share.  Melvin goes bankrupt with $1B in assets, not the $5B now owed.

That entity still gets a huge $1B payout as Melvin is liquidated.  Far, far more than they ever could realistically expect Gamestop to have increased in value.  It's still a windfall, just less than the absurd sum on paper that was rather hypothetical.</text>

There are 40-45 houses on the market to buy and there are about the same number available to rent.

Hedge funds rent all the houses they can at variable rates and then create new deeds for them and sell them on the open market.

They then rent those same houses again from the new owners and sell them again to yet more people.

They wait for a price crash to buy them back and return to their landlords. The intent is to pocket the difference vs buy price &amp; rent.

There are now 60-70 claims of ownership floating around for the same 40-45 houses.

Retail investors buy them up and hold on to them.

Average price goes up.

Future dated agreements to buy houses expire and the buyers exercise their contract to buy the house agreed.

Average price goes up.

Some short sellers realise what this means at a macro level and buy in to cover their position by returning houses to the landlords.

Price goes up.

Other short sellers forge even more deeds of ownership, get the auction houses to close bidding by any retail investors and start selling their own deeds to each other at lower and lower prices to manipulate market price down on Thursday.

Some owners who don't understand the market see their ticker price go down and bail out.

Those who do understand what's going on are prevented from making their own purchase decisions by the auction houses.

The hedge funds get some (relatively) cheap houses back.

Outcry.

Auction houses let retail investors back in and hope not to get eaten alive by lawsuits while at the same time admitting to market manipulation live on tv.

Price goes back up. Shorts aren't covered near enough. Congress demands investigation of wall street. SEC chief who was paid 800,000 by the hedge funds somehow thinks she's not in conflict of interest and the outrage gets bigger.

In the background, shorts are watching their rent rates go up. And up. And up. They can't simply afford to hold forever. Homeowners however absolutely can hold forever.

In the background of all this, the auction house has significant financial agreements with the market maker who directs sellers to the auction houses, and the market maker takes a significant stake in the hedge fund short position.

Yes, the guy that you trust to act as an intermediary between buyer and seller is now in conflict of interest with his own clients. As performing his contractually obligated duty to match buyer and seller will have a negative impact on his short position.

So. We now enter Friday.

This is not financial advice and likely loses some context with the comparison but it's as eli5 as I can make it.</text>

    <text>All-time High. The highest pricepoint an asset has seen up until that point. Doge will break that through sheer memevalue, but it's impossible to predict how high and subsequently how low it will go, which makes it extra risky especially for new people since they don't know when to sell. After the hype dies down doge will fall hard to less than a cent since it does essentially nothing, which will result in pretty hefty losses if you held too long.</text>

    <text>&gt; GameStop down like 140% I think?

No, that's not it. Someone realized that all the hedge funds combined had promised to buy 140% of the shares, or 40% more shares than all the shares that exist for gamestop. This meant that if everybody bought the GME shares to drive the price up, those funds would be FORCED to buy all shares back at any price, bankrupting them.

    <text>No robinhood literally took GME off the trading platform. We could only sell our shares we cannot buy or buy calls or puts. Everyone outside of Robin Hood and TD Ameritrade and Schwab were able to successfully buy and sell GME. They gave away out for hedge fund billionaires to cut their losses on their short sells. Which only makes the price of the stock goes down obviously</text>

    <text>sort of right.

Shorting is when you borrow the asset from someone now, and sell it immediately at its current price. You then give it back to them in the future, when hopefully it's price has fallen. 

E.G You sell a banana now for $10. In a week, you have to give the banana back, so you buy it at it's price then, which is $5. You made $10 from selling it, it cost you $5 to rebuy, therefore you made $5 in profit. 

Because you are selling the banana now, that drives the price down. When you have to rebuy the banana, that drives the price up.

It is worth noting that shorting a stock does not really "ruin" the company so to speak, it makes life more difficult in certain ways, but it's not like they're walking in and taking money out of the companies pocket.

The 140% figure you're quoting was the open short interest. This is basically the total amount of shares short sold, divided by the total amount of shares. It's a little confusing, but yes, that value can be over 100%. 

There are 10 bananas in circulation, A borrows 7 from B and sell them to C. D borrows 7 from C, and sells them to E. 

A owes 7 Bananas to B, D owes 7 bananas to C; 14 bananas in total are owed even though only 10 exist.

Now if the price of the banana suddenly shoots up, the people that borrowed it will lose money when they rebuy the banana.

Of course, they may simply wait to buy the banana back, however if they used someone else's money to multiply their potential gains by selling 20 bananas when they could only afford to buy back 10 (called leverage, think of it like a loan), if the price goes high enough then the losses start being the losses of whoever loaned them the money. At that point, whoever loaned them the money might force them to buy the bananas, and realise the loss.</text>

    <text>So one thing I still don’t understand about all that is how promising to buy a stock lower drives it down. Aren’t stocks based on how many people buy them? Is this like some rich person collusion scheme to specifically *not* buy these stocks so that those who promised to buy lower will get to do so? Is it like a feedback loop of rich person 1 buying lower, rich person 2 selling off, and then rich person 1 selling off after rich person 2 bets on it being lower? And if so, I’m confused on how that results in a profit for said rich people, unless they’re betting on the stock dropping or something.

Sorry if these are dumb questions, stocks are really unfamiliar territory for me but this event feels historical so I want to get a basic of idea of why it’s going down the way it is.</text>

    <text>I’ll plan to watch this video tonight when I have time (I’ve technically got college work to do right now), but if I could just ask one thing: how is short selling immoral? It sounds to me, from the previous comment I read, that they’re promising to buy a stock that goes lower. Isn’t that just like betting on what you think the stock will do? Is there some collusion or something going on behind the scenes, or an aspect to this that I’m missing.

I have no question that what’s happening now to stop WSB is immoral, I just don’t quite understand why the previous status quo was immoral.</text>

    <text>I certainly agree on and understand the second paragraph, I’m still a bit confused on the first though. So the hedge funds were profiting off of a business failing, but were they doing anything to specifically cause the business to fail? Because it would seem, to me, that simply profiting off of a predication that a business would fail isn’t bad in itself (that’d just be betting after all), unless of course the hedge funds are doing something to cause it to fail. Also, I don’t quite understand how one profits from a business failing, at least in the ways I’ve seen it mentioned so far.

I guess my main confusion surrounds how the hedge funds worked before the fiasco, and what exactly was morally sketchy about them (like if they were actively causing GameStop stocks to fall somehow in order to profit, or if they were just betting that GameStop stocks *would* fall).</text>

    <text>How is it even possible to sell something you don’t own, and to profit off of that? I guess my main confusion here lies with the short-selling, I don’t really get how it works so I can’t assess it’s morality for myself.

I’ve seen a lot of arguments that this is getting back at the rich people in the hedge funds for all the immoral crap they’ve done, and I can understand that logic even if I don’t understand enough to know what those rich people actually did (something about the ‘08 recession that I don’t really understand).</text>

There’s still some things I don’t get (borrowing and selling and borrowing again), but overall, I feel like you gave me a pretty good handle on the situation. One small thing I’d like to clarify is who they’re borrowing shares from. I’d assume they’re borrowing directly from GameStop, is that correct?

    <text>Fun story where this actually happened;

 In 2017, a Texas furniture store ran a promotion that would refund customers if the Houston Astros won the world series. They won and store paid $13 million in refunds.

The owner ran the same promotion  in 2019. Again, the Astros made it to the world series.  He tried to buy insurance but couldn't, so he he went to Vegas and put millions on the Astros. They lost, he lost the bet, but he also didn't have to pay out all the refunds.

    <text>So would the hedge funds’ overall morality be related more to their historical practices, rather than their more recent short-selling of GameStop? Or was the short-selling immoral in a way too?

I think I understand the rest of what you said. WSB’s market collusion could be argued to be immoral, but if it’s against people who have been doing immoral things to everyone for their own benefit for years, it would be hypocritical to get pissy about one and not the other.</text>

    <text>I believe what we saw today was basically the clearing houses requiring increasing the margin from a typical couple percent to the full 100% of the stock price.

    <text>But I see a problem there. You say and everyone seems to assume that they are required by law to buy those stocks to cover their short positions. At some point they could just refuse to play along and say that the market has been manipulated or whatever, go to their buddies in Congress or whomever they're paying, and they will get trading to stop or nullify their contracts or whatever.
I am quite sure this would happen if a "too big to fail" institution was in play.

Is this essentially a bet that - since we're talking about one unimportant stock and a few relatively unimportant hedge funds - they are not big and powerful enough to make a difference for the government and thus will not be protected / bailed out?..</text>

    <text>Well, no. Call options have weekly and monthly expiry dates. You cannot get daily options (unless you buy options that expire tomorrow today).

Expiry will always be on a Friday unless the market is closed due to a national holiday. Otherwise you're right though, you can get them years out. I have Nokia calls that expire a little over a year from now. You can buy GME calls that expire weekly until the end of February, after that it's monthly (but a new weekly option is added every time one reaches expiry).</text>

    <text>I understood shorting thanks to this thread, what I don't understand how 140% shorting was made possible. How did the shorters borrow more shares from shareholders like us, when shareholders like us could only buy as much as GameStop was offering? 

How did they create more stocks, i.e. the extra 40%?</text>

    <text>To add on: hedge funds that shorted can't wait this out either, because shorting a stock requires interest payments (tied to stock value) until they buy the stock and give it back to the broker. Trying to wait it out could just as easily bankrupt them as trying to close their position right now. Some of them have partially closed their position, but there are still more shorts than actual shares, so the retail investors who are buying and holding expect the price to go up even further.</text>

    <text>Market cap is the total value of all the shares (number of shares * value of each share). The company determines the total number of shares. The market determines the value of each share. The two together determine the market cap, or total company value.


You might ask, why not just issue more shares and the value of the company goes up! In theory, as a company issues more shares, the market would correct and bring the value of each share down. However we live in a clown world now I guess because companies like Tesla issue more shares and the price goes up. 

There are a lot of irrational things happening in the market right now for a lot of reasons.</text>

    <text>Because it technically is. Buying a stock means that you believe the company is going to be successful and the price is going to go up. Thus you have a vested interest in seeing the company succeed.

&amp;#x200B;

Shorting is the opposite, you believe the company is going to fuck up and the price is going to go down. You have a vested interest in destroying that company (and any people employed there too). It's a shitty way to do business and you are adding zero benefit to the economy.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit:

Take all of what I said with a grain of salt, then add in a barrel of salt. Stocks are traded on a secondary market, they do impact the company but only if they wish to offer more stock.

There is a lot more nuance to short selling and Papa Musk may just be saying that because he doesn't want anyone to short his own company.</text>

    <text>At this point, you need to look at it a lot like gambling. The time to really get in on it _mostly safely_ was in the double digits.

It's only worth what it is because there are a lot of naked shorts out (meaning the person will have to purchase shares to cover their position) and r/wallstreetbets is doing an admirable job of buying up shares and keeping the price high. The flipside of that is anyone who isn't going hard on options is going to have to sell those shares at some point to make their money, and once the overleveraged shorts vanish... well. Gonna be a bad time.</text>

    <text>The potential price could go up a lot from where it currently is, $1000 or more isn't unrealistic. However it's important to understand that this isn't based on any real fundamentals of trading, this is effectively gambling, it could pay off big, or it could (like today) lose 70% of it's value in one hour. 

In my opinion (and this is not advice, do so at your own risk), if you can get in at ~150-200 and you're willing to ride it all the way, yeah definitely profit to be had</text>

    <text>Basically that doesn't happen. When you short a stock, you have to put up some collateral - this is called "margin." As the position goes against the hedge fund, the fund's broker demands that more and more collateral be posted. The broker never permits the situation to get to the point where insufficient collateral exists.</text>

    <text>Shorting a stock has potential for infinite loss because technically the stock could go up forever. Normally its just really bad for shorters when this happens. The other big one involved porsche and volkswagon. Porsche announced they were going to buy VW and the stock went wild. Eventually porsche let them off the hook with just 30 billion in losses when they sold their shares for a huge profit instead of doing a takeover (porsche really just wanted some cash and this was a way to do it, they made 10 billion).

The difference here is that retail investors arent big car companies looking for a cash infusion. Their intended goal (at least for now) is to sink the funds. They possibly can do it. We will have to wait and see.

Here is an article. Interestingly it mentions Steve Cohen who is involved in this fiasco too. He lost 250mil on porsche.

    <text>Possibly unrelated but under capitalism a company doesn’t really die. It’s more that it was eaten. Capital doesn’t vanish it just moves. Given that the most savvy capitalists (read: evil/greedy/sociopathic) tend to fare better, odds are that a failing company is a feeding frenzy for other capital owners looking to grow. In this circumstance (GME etc) the feeding frenzy favoured the 99. Every other day it just feeds another 1%er when a company dies.</text>

    <text>Negative take: most firms are leveraged to the hilt in their various holdings due to years of easy money monetary supply. Loans are cheap and equity markets provide the best returns. Eventuality those short GME are going to have to cover. Either because they do or because their broker who loaned them the shares says enough and does it for them. In either scenario, those firms are going to have a massive fire sale of their holdings which is going to drive the prices of those holdings down. Firms then long those holdings on leverage are going to get margin called and have to liquidate holdings to cover. This will create a feedback loop and you would witness an epic crash similar to March.

Positive take:shorts have to cover but their fire sale doesn't overpower buyers. Market takes a correction style dip and stabilizes. A lot of young retail investors come away with a truck load of money they dump into clearing debt and buying houses. Driving a massive economic multiplier that issues a new boom.</text>

    <text>I mean the damage was done today, whereas a lot of the losses the hedgefund could have faced at a price of 300 were mitigated (although still huge). When the retail investing was cut off from buys, it naturally follows that the stock would only drop, and anyone with a broker could then buy. This also allows the rich to buy a dip that the retail investor had no access to.</text>

    <text>Depends on government.
It's fairly obvious that hedge funds gave the capability to influence the market through connections with apps and media.  If they regulate enough, maybe we can get a more stable market and in turn a slightly better economy.
If they don't do anything or legislate against retail buyers, we will most definitely have more market crashes like in 2008 and the entirety of the 45th presidents term.  Then our economy isn't worth fuckall since the wealth disparity won't get any better and nobody can buy more than basic necessities.</text>

    <text>A company issues a stock and sells it in return for ownership in the company. That stock is listed on a stock exchange that matches up buyers and sellers. Brokers buy those stocks and create a market place for buyers amd sellers. It’s all done with computers, but, essentially a person says, I’d like to sell my ownership in this company for this proposed price. Hopefully, there is someone on the other side saying, I’d like to buy someone”s ownership in that company’s for this proposed price. When there is a match the broker facilitates the sale and purchase and makes sure the seller is paid and the owner has a record of the ownership of the stock. It literally used to be done with people trading pieces of paper for cash.

Typically, people buy a stock because they think the price of the stock is going to increase. However, there are some people who believe it will decrease. The broker is willing to take a bet from the person who thinks it will go down. The broker essentially finds someone who is willing to lend their share to the broker who then allows the other person to own it for a period of time with the understanding that he will buy it in the future for a lower price. They have to pay interest on the loan. When that time comes, the short seller has to buy the stock, no matter the price, regardless if it higher or lower. If he was right and it is lower, he made money for every penny the price decreased when the original lost a penny. However, if the price is higher, he has to pay the owner for every penny it increased.

A short squeeze is when a stock has a lot of short sellers and the price has quickly risen. When that happens, the interest on the loan increases and the amount they lose increases. Every day they hold then short, it gets exponentially more expensive to hold the short and eventually they sell, driving up the price more, which forces another short to sell, driving up the price more, which forces another short to sell and on and on. It drives up the price very quickly.

There are companies out there that collect billions of dollars from investors and pool all the money into one giant pool. For example, one may have a ten billion dollar fund. They then go to a bank and say, I want to borrow 100 billion dollars and you can use this 10 billion as collateral. The bank agrees and gives them another 100 billion dollars. The fund managers of these companies do this and they go to dinner and all decide they are going to short a specific company’s stock to drive the price down to essentially guarantee the price will go down. That’s one form of stock manipulation and is what has happened with GME. A hedge fund decided they wanted to destroy a company and colluded with other hedge funds and decided to drive the price down via short selling. Some people realized they had done too much short selling and they could get in real trouble if a bunch of people bought a lot of stock very quickly and drove the price up.</text>

    <text>That's not actually true, considering it can be traded for currency. Bitcoin literally has no value either by that logic. Paper money has literally no value unless we assign value to it. Maybe you're sad you didn't buy in when it was worth 1000% less than it is now?</text>

So the person who borrows pays a borrowing fee or the person who lends charges a borrowing fee.

    <text>Float or free float usually refers to the proportion of stocks held by investors that is in principle available for buying and selling. Stocks not in the free float may be those held by CEO-founders and similar “strategic” investors who are expected not to sell under any circumstance, removing their shares from circulation.</text>

    <text>The shares floating are the number of shares available for trading. So some companies might only release 10% of shares for their IPO, some release almost all the shares. Which would be closer to 100%</text>

    <text>Melvin borrowed a ton of shares from GameStop and sold them at $5 a share with the promise to buy them back later. This is called “Shorting.” If the stock is worth less when it’s time to buy them back, then Melvin made money on their gamble. If the stock costs more when it comes time to buy those shares back, then Melvin has lost money on the deal. They are betting GameStop will fail and that they can buy the shares back for pennies. Melvin has also been reported to have been actively working to push GameStop out of business, further increasing their profits while putting thousands out of jobs in the middle of a pandemic.

Enter Reddit. A subreddit full of people to love to bet on stocks and screw over the billionaires of Wall Street, watched Melvin short GameStop. But not just a little bit. They shorted 150% of GameStop’s shares meaning they borrowed more shares than exist, and then sold them, promising to buy them back later. A bunch of people on Reddit came together and started buying up GameStop shares. This increases demand which drives the price up. As the stock price increases, Melvin has to start buying shares back at an increased price in order to stop losing money. This further increases the demand for shares and drives the price up even more, making it more expensive for Melvin to buy in. It’s a self feeding upwards loop. As more people get involved, it gets even more expensive for Melvin to buy back their shares. There really is no cap on how much money they could lose here.

This is now costing Melvin billions of dollars and corruption on wall street is being revealed as these people are stuck owing billions of dollars. Apps that are allowing every day people to get involved are magically running into issues which are limiting people’s ability to buy GameStop shares.

When you short a stock, you also have to pay interest on it. It’s my understanding that that short is due today. So Melvin is going to have to pay interest on all these stocks. It’s going to be an interesting Friday.</text>

    <text>A bunch of hedge funds decided to short GameStop (and some other companies). Shorting is an investment practice wherein you make money if the price goes down. Essentially, you agree to borrow some stocks from someone today and immediately sell them. Then tomorrow you buy them back at a lower price and return them to the original owner and keep the difference. This is opposite to going long, where you buy stocks at a low price and sell them when they are higher. 

The possibility of profit when going long is infinite (the stock can continue to climb in price) and the possibility of loss is limited (the price can’t go below zero, so the most you can lose is what you put in). When you short, those two possibilities are flipped. The possibility of profit is limited, and the possibility of loss is infinite. 

Redditors noticed that this was happening and that it was happening at a very high rate - over 140% of the stock was shorted, which is a bad thing. When the shorts come due you have to buy enough stock to “cover” your shorts, and so there will come a point that you must buy the stock no matter the price.

So Wall Street bets decided to convince everyone to start buying GameStop stock. When stocks are bought, that generally causes the price to rise. The hedge funds that had shorted GameStop now had to cover their shorts and were forced to also buy stock at a loss. That in turn caused the price to rise some more, and the redditors who had bought with a long position made money, and the hedge funds lost money. As more and more people bought GameStop the price continued to rise, forcing the hedge funds to lose more and more money. This is called a short squeeze. The big problem for the hedge funds is that fact that more stock was shorted than exists, so at some point there are going to be some extremely unhappy funds. 

Now these billionaire hedge funds are whining about how the poors are manipulating the market, despite the fact that them shorting the stock in the first place and therefore selling tons of stock was depressing the price artificially anyway, so any accusation of manipulation can easily be reversed</text>

    <text>Some big players on Wallstreet (Hedge Funds) made the bet that the value of GameStop would go down (this is called shorting a stock and involves borrowing shares to sell). Others have rallied (partially because of r/wallstreetbets and bought a lot of GameStop shares therefore increasing the value of GameStop as a whole. 
This puts the Hedgefunds that have bet on GameStop’s value going down in a very compromised position. If the stock stays high, hedgefunds lose big time, and people holding shares win big. This is causing the establishment to panic, trying to make the value go down. Crazy stuff is happening like Robinhood blocking people from buying more shares to increase the value. 

Over simplified, but hope that helps</text>

    <text>Can somebody explain to me how are the retail investors/wsb guys going to save their investment? Because from what i understand, GME is overvalued right now? And when all the buying stops, won't the price eventually correct itself? Melvin is loosing money for now, until the price is high but eventually won't it go back to normal when the dust settles?</text>

    <text>Yes you can. For instance Robinhood has a transfer option that has a $75 fee.

The problem is that its not instant. It can take weeks, and the account is frozen during that process. If you're waiting on a short squeeze, the last thing you want is for your stocks to be frozen. So if you have GME through RH the best course of action would be to wait for the squeeze to sell, then transfer/close your RH account and move elsewhere.</text>

    <text>In honor of GameStop, I'll make a loose video game analogy.

Normally, buying a stock is like buying a PS5 at launch with the intent to resell it on eBay later. You can purchase it at a store for a (relatively) low price and hopefully can sell it later at a higher price and keep the difference.

But imagine you are at the tail end of that PS5 launch bonanza. People are still bidding up PS5s on eBay because they're still really hard to find on the shelves, but that won't last forever. Maybe you know (or believe) that a huge shipment of PS5s is coming next week and then they will be in every Target and Walmart and the era of selling PS5s on eBay for $2000 will end. If only there were a way to make a quick buck off this...

Enter the practice called **shorting.**

So imagine you create an eBay account and start selling PS5s that **you don't own yet**, selling them for $2000 each. You believe you can get away with this because you're *convinced* that, next week, you can just stroll down to any Walmart and buy as many PS5s as you need for $500 each. You're making a tidy profit selling something at a high cost that you know you could buy later at a low price. And you keep doing this, more and more. Soon you're selling more PS5s than will even be arriving in that shipment next week. But that's ok! People are bidding PS5s so high that you know you can take that money and *buy back* a PS5 you just sold and give it to someone else who will now pay even more! You're brilliant! You're rich! And you did it all without ever actually purchasing any PS5s... yet.

But thats the thing. You NEED those PS5s now. You already took peoples money and its time to deliver. You're ass in on the line. And thats how this is **different** from buying PS5s and then reselling them after. At least if *that* scheme falls through you still own a PS5 that you can maybe return, or sell to a GameStop (at a loss). With **shorting** you *need* to get those PS5s, at any cost, or a mob of angry customers will tear you apart.

Now imagine *someone* got word of your little scheme. They realized that, very soon, you'd need to procure a LARGE number of PS5s at retail prices or there will be mobs breaking down your door demanding blood.

This *someone* is fucking sick of PS5s scalpers like you driving up prices and preventing the average joe from buying a new video game system as a Christmas gift for their kid. This *someone* sees **YOU** as the embodyment of greed and evil that has drained the nation of hope.

So this *someone* gathers together about 2 million of their friends for a little shopping spree. They buy up every PS5 they can find, clearing the shelves and preventing you from buying a single one. You come to them begging and pleading for PS5s. You offer $700. $1000. $1500. But this *someone* and their friends won't sell. Many of them don't even *want* the PS5s. But they were bored, wanted to make a quick buck, and most of all they *also* hate your fucking guts.

Soon you are so desperate that you'll pay $2000. $3000. Now you're offeeing to buy them at a loss, a horrific financial loss. But that loss is still better than being torn limb from limb by customers demanding the PS5s you sold them. This *someone* knows this, and they are preparing to *squeeze* you for every cent you're worth.

And that is what's going on now. A big Wallstreet hedgefund sold a shit ton of GameStop stock that they did not technically own, betting that they could buy it later at a cheaper price. This is what it means to **shorting a stock**, and its actually fucking **LEGAL**. But that hedgefund did this to an *incredibly* irresponsible degree, selling more of the stock than actually exists. They did not expect a hoard of disgruntled, bitter, amateur investors on Reddit to catch them with their pants down. So r/wallstreetbets got wind of this a few weeka ago and begun to buy the stock, driving up the price 100x what it was. And the people who created the shorts have lost billions trying to buy enough stock to meet their deliverables. 

Of course there's some more nuance here, and there will be consequences of driving up a stocks price so high. But that's the best summary I got.</text>

    <text>Usually it happens accidentally or through no fault of the short seller - it’s when the same share held at a custodian / broker gets used by two separate people to sell.  It’s almost always the clearing house’s fault, not the hedge fund’s.</text>

    <text>I’m not quite sure myself but I think an institution is allowed to short more stocks than are available if there is a reasonable chance that they can fulfill it by the expiration date, however, this becomes reasonably impossible when a bunch of meme lords buy the shares that *you* were intending to purchase back at a lower price, driving up demand as they hold and you still need to buy while your contracts near expiration. Again, I’m not positive, but I think this is what happened with gme because it was way overshorted. I hope this isn’t completely wrong and that someone else chimes in if it is.</text>

    <text>To short a stock, borrow the stock then sell that borrowed stock. Then you can do whatever you want with the money gained from the sale. When you want to exit the position, you need to buy it back off the market and give it back to the lender. That way, your returns are directly inverse the price of the stock</text>

    <text>In addition to all the reasons others have already given, another reason banks don’t (or can’t) dump all their cash into stocks is capital requirements. These basically say “if you have this much in risky investments, then you need to keep that much capital on hand.” These rules are in place to prevent banks from taking on too much risk, as they did in the subprime mortgage crisis. If the bank loses all their money in the stock market, they can’t honor the deposits people made there, and they would default on their own debt. So part of the answer is it’s unacceptably risky for a bank to invest all their assets in the stock market, and personal loans are safer.</text>

    <text>All the other answers here are wrong. The real answer has to do with how the equities markets work. There are firms called "market makers" that act as middle men between people who want to buy shares and people who want to sell them. Market makers stand ready at all times to buy at a certain price and to sell at a certain price. They don't care about the underlying company, they're just in the middle facilitating the trading. When a seller comes to them wanting to go short a stock, the market maker accepts the order, but then has to go find shares somewhere to lend to pair off against that position. When you "short" a stock, what you're really doing is borrowing shares from someone and then selling them to someone else - the market maker has to find the lender for you. If the market maker *fails* to find anyone to lend the shares, they end up "naked" short. They are not allowed to stay that way for very long, they have to find shares or else reverse the short sellers trade.</text>

    <text>This is such a great question. No doubt the market is complex, and the banks stand to gain from people using the money they borrowed to purchase the shit they own through stocks but it's likely way more complex than that.</text>

    <text>There's a lot of pieces to this and I'm not super familiar with all of them.  I assume you're talking about things like mortgages, right?

A lot of banks give you a mortgage, then sell the debt to others.  That way, they have no risk associated with your debt, they just make money by servicing the loan.

The ones that hold the debt may do fancy things like bundle up thousands of mortgages and sell them as low risk investment options.  These are called derivatives, as their value is derived from something else.  More specifically, they're called CDOs, collective debt obligations.  

The S&amp;P 500 goes up faster than the interest rate of most loans, but can vary WILDLY.  It can easily lose 50% in a year.  If this is money one wants to have access to in less than 10 years, one might want to consider safer investments.  

Banks loan rates are loosely correlated to the federal funds rate.  When the fed raises rates, loan rates tend to go up.  So does interest rates on things like savings accounts.  It's also loosely correlated with inflation, though the causation probably runs the other way.  

It's like there's a berjillion moving parts, so it's hard to understand one part without seeing how it all fits together.</text>

    <text>Hedge funds have multiple brokers called prime brokers. Melvin for instance has 4. They deal with each of them individually. What they HF can do is say, buy 100 shares. Tell each of these brokers individually that they want to 100 shares and can cover it as they own 100 shares. Since the brokers have no way to know what their dealings are with other brokers, they can short sell 400 shares with 4 brokers while only having wherewithal to cover for 100.</text>

Imagine, your bank for example, it doesn't lend money to you only - so when you have millions of clients, trust me, it is profitable. 
Btw, most banks also got a Nostro division, where they invest the bank's reserves and cash.</text>

    <text>You don't actually have to "buy" the shares later, you just have to "locate" them. The entities that engage in naked shorting are market makers. Market makers don't hold positions in the stock, they just maintain a price at which they'll buy and a price at which they'll sell - they're middle men. So when they agree to let someone go short, they then have to find someone else to lend the shares to the short seller. If they fail to find such a person, then they end up "naked" short, because they haven't "covered" the short by finding shares for the short seller to borrow.</text>

    <text>For number 2, here is a copy paste of my answer for another comment:

&amp;#x200B;

**Bob** borrows **Sarah's Harry Potter book series** and then sells it **Sam**.

**Sam** then let's **Rebecca** borrow that same Harry Potter book series and she sells it to **Lucifer**.

It's the same item, but there are two people who have borrowed it and have to return it to their owners:

* Bob ==&gt; Sarah
* Rebecaa ==&gt; Sam

For this to be resolved, Bob has to go buy the book from Lucifer and give it back to Sarah. And then Rebecca has to go convince Sarah to sell her the book so that she can return it to Sam.

You can see how bad a short squeeze might be in this scenario.</text>

    <text>A is the person who wants to short a stock. They go to their broker and say I want to sell 10 shares of $GME. The broker has other accounts and B has at least 10 shares of $GME. So the broker sells 10 of B's $GME shares and gives the money from the sale to A. Then after the price falls and A wants to lock in their gain, or the price rises and they want to stop losing, they will "exit the short" buy buying 10 shares of $GME. Since those shares never belonged to A, when they buy them the broker will replace them in B's portfolio.

Now, while all this is going on, B has no idea their shares were used to short sell for A. So if B decides to exit their position, the broker has to shift things around. If the stock pays a dividend, A is responsible to pay the dividend to B. So essentially B has no idea this is happening but also has no loss during this whole.

How $GME was shorted by more shares than they have, I don't understand that.</text>

    <text>1. I can, but it depends on the ToS you agreed to with your broker.

2. The same share can be shorted again if the person who bought it makes it available to short again. Typically no one single entity would short a stock with more than 100%, that would be stupid, but if enough different entities do the total shorted might exceed 100%, and they will end up competing for the available shares should the price go up and therefore the need to cover.

EDIT: Also, once Hedgefund A has shorted, they no longer own the share. Here’s a step by step:

i. Company issues shares because they want money. Investors buy the shares from the company.

ii. Investors start trading the shares with each other, and the price where they decide to trade becomes the price of the share.

iii. Brokers, such as RH or TD Ameritrade, let’s investors sign up, transfer money and/or shares onto their platform. This makes trading a lot easier (this is when the Investor signs the agreement that says ”yes, my shares are available to short”)

iv. One Investor, A, thinks the price of share X is to high. He wants to bet against, so he goes to the broker and says ”hey, let me borrow 100 share of X please”. The Broker responds with ”sure, that will cost 32% annually of the shares price in interest, compounded daily”. (a bit technical, but basically it costs a lot of money to short because the risk is high, and as the price goes up the cost can become astronomical since it’s based on a daily price rather than whatever you bought it for).

v. The Broker takes a share out of Investor B’s account, because B allowed shorting of his shares, and lend it out to A. In the agreement between the Broker and B it says that any dividends will be covered by the broker in the mean time, and in the agreement with A it says that any dividends will be covered by A. The broker is just a middleman between A and B, but as such takes on the risk that A can’t pay, hence they keep the majority of the interest.

vi. A now has one share borrowed, but since he doesn’t believe in it he turns around and sell it on the market to C for $10. A hopes that in time, he can buy it back for less than $10 + interest, and at that point he will return it to the broker who will in turn return it to B.
In this way, A gets the money from shorting up front, but doesn’t know how much he will have to buy it for in the future when he needs to return it.

vii. C also has an account with a broker, and along comes D who also wants to short the share. Through the broker he borrows the same share, turns around and sell it to E. The share has now been shorted twice. Only one real share exists, and it is in E’s account. But A owes one share to B, and D owes one share to C. Both B and C meanwhile, when they look at their account, will see a share of X sitting there, even though it actually isn’t. Share-credits has inflated the share supply, much as money-credit inflates the money supply.

Hope this was clear-ish!</text>

    <text>Edit sorry I switched A and B around from who they were in your question

Let's say A is a broker who was never going to sell their shares they're holding them long term. When they give them to B they're letting them borrow them for a short term and charging interest during that time. 

Think of the shares as a lawn mower. A owns a mower that he's not planning on selling any time soon as he has a long term need for it. He lends the mower to B on the understanding that B will give the mower back in 10 days plus some interest to sweeten the deal. A can't lose in this deal as B has to legally give him back his mower plus some interest.

B, being a dick, immediately sells the mower hoping that in 10 days time he will be able to buy an identical mower at a lower price to fulfil his legal obligation to give A back his mower but pocketing the profits from selling the first mower.

However 9 days later Reddit retards have bought up all the mowers in town massively driving up the price of mowers. In order to give A back a mower B now has to buy a mower at a ridiculous price and cover the interest so B is about to lose a shit load of money.

A doesn't care, he gets his mower back AND some interest AND his mower is now worth shit tons.

A is the broker, B is a hedge fund, the mower is $GME, Reddit, sadly is Reddit.</text>

    <text>Yes you are right, shorting is only good for the people doing the shorting (A) and B loses out as their stock price falls. I don’t think B can necessarily choose who they give their stock to, if they could then there would be no shorting because why would they want that to happen to them? B is definitely hoping that the price goes up when they get shorted because when A eventually has to give the shares back it will be at a higher price</text>

    <text>1. Yeah you can. If you want that call your broker to see the options. Most of the time you can but your costs wil rise a little bit because they cant make money over those shares.

2. A fund can borrow shares from pension funds, large asset managers like vanguard and blackrock and brokers (and more). When they borrow those shares they directly sell them in the market. Those shares can be bought on the market by the same big institutions and then another fund can call up the big institutional funds and sell them again</text>

    <text>I'll try and ELI5.

Your friend wants help moving next month. You tell him you'll do it for $100, but he has to pay you $2 now to lock in the rate. Your friend agrees. This is a call option. Next month comes around and he realizes he can hire professional movers for $50. So he decides to do that because it's cheaper than paying you $100. The other way it could go is next month it costs $200 for professional movers, so he reminds you that you agreed to do it for $100. 

Now take this and apply it to a stock. If you buy ("go long") a call option, you pay a premium for it to the seller (who is "short" the call) so that at an after upon date (expiration date) you have the right, but not the obligation, to buy a stock at the agreed upon (strike) price. Using numbers from above, if your stock is trading at $200, well you just made money. You can exercise your option and buy the stock for $100 and then if you wanted immediately sell it for $200, and you just made $98 in profit ($100 in gain minus initial $2 premium paid for it) give or take transaction fees. That means the seller just lost that amount. 

The put option is just the right, but not the obligation, to sell the stock at the expiration date and strike price.</text>

    <text>This is incorrect as far as I know. The only "due date" on the shorts is when it becomes the better choice to close than to pay more interest.

On Friday, option calls will expire which means that people will have to buy stocks  and sell them to the buyers of their calls at the strike price of the call.

    <text>So let’s explain it like the asset is a house..... say you own a 250k house. I come along and offer you 10k right now and all I ask for in return is the right to buy your house for a specified price (let’s say 250k, it could be any price, but we choose this one) and this contract expires on January 1st next year. If the house becomes worth 300k the day before it expires then I would force you to sell me the house for 250k.... in all you have 260k for your house (the 10k premium and the 250k for the sale).... I on the other hand just made a +400% return because all I did was gamble 10k and make +40k profit (I paid 10k for the contract, and can buy the house at 250k and simultaneously sell the house at 300k).... I do face a huge risk because if the house doesn’t become worth 260k then I face a 100% loss... this is a call option

Now a put is best explained like insurance. You own the house and want to have the rights to cover the loss of the house (let’s say by a fire) at a set price, let’s say 250k again. All you do is pay for a contract to cover your house. You pay a premium for a certain amount of coverage for a certain amount of time. You pay 5k for the year (I know this isn’t an actual fire insurance quote, work with me for easy numbers).... if your 250k house becomes worthless then you have your put to force someone else to buy it at 250k...

So now let’s wrap it up into stocks... say apple stock is looking hot, it’s trading at $100 a share, you see that you can buy a call on it for $10 and have the right to buy it for a year, or you can buy it at $100.... let’s say that at years end it ends up trading at $125. If you bought the share, you made $25, a 25% gain.... if you bought the call, you paid $10, can now buy the share at $100 and instantly sell at $125, $125-($100+$10)=$15. you made a $15 gain on a $10 premium, a 150% gain. However, if apple trades at $100-$110, you get back some money but you made a loss.... if it trades at $100 or less, 100% loss.....</text>

    <text>I'm curious about your second question also. So far I've only seen answers like "it happened because reasons" but it kinda looks like hedge funds are just allowed to short imaginary shares. u/deepfuckingvalue caught on to the situation and did two things: buy a shitload of real shares and post a meme to reddit. Now here we are.

It sounds like the funds never actually had to borrow the shares, just say that they could cover them, so when multiple funds did that, they ended up with a cumulative total of more share than exist, even though there were still real shares available to trade.</text>

    <text>Not ELI5 but I tried:

A "call" is a contract that gives you the right to buy 100 shares of a stock at a certain price (the "strike price") on or before the expiration date of the contract. If stock "XXX" is trading at $20/share when you open the trade, and you expect that value to rise in a couple months, you might buy the "22c" with an expiration date of two months into the future. This means you expect the price of XXX to increase by at least two dollars. Imagine it cost $100 for the contract (this is called "premium"). Premium is calculated using a mathematical model.

- XXX is trading $20/share

- Contract: 22c w/expiration at 2mo

- Premium paid: $100

There are three potential outcomes. For simplicity's sake, let's say you didn't close your contract before expiration:

1) XXX stays below $22. Your contract expires worthless, because although you have the right to execute the contract and collect your shares, it would be cheaper for you to just buy them on the market.

2) XXX went above $22 (a little). Let's say it hit $22.50. Well, your contract allows you to buy the shares for less than they're worth at the time of expiration, but the price hasn't gone up enough to cover that premium you paid for the contract. In this instance, you're losing $50. Try to work out the math for this.

3) XXX went way above $22. Let's say it hit a cool $25. Your contract grants you the RIGHT to buy 100 shares for $22, regardless of the price at expiration. You now made $200! Congratulations, you were able to double your money because you predicted the unlikely rise in the value of a stock, even though the stock only increased by 20%.

Options with a higher percent chance of profit (closer to "the money") are more expensive. 

Puts are literally contracts that allow you to sell 100 shares of a stock at the strike price on or before the expiration date of the contract. In this instance, instead of wanting to buy the stock for less than it's worth, your goal is to sell the stock for more than it's worth.</text>

Others are just holding on until everyone at WallStreetBets agrees that it's the right time to sell, and that hasn't happened yet.</text>

Puts give the buyer the right (but not the obligation) to sell the shares at the strike price at any point till expiry to the seller.

For these rights, buyers pay sellers a premium. If the buyers do not exercise these rights by the time of expiry, sellers get to keep the premium.</text>

    <text>I think funds that use short strategies are going to be a lot more wary of high %short stocks in the future. I'm sure some of them will get greedy and think "there's no way this will happen again," and there's a chance that a group like WSB will take advantage. But, there's been a huge push in the investment community to include alternative data in stock analysis. This data, among many other things, includes comments on social media platforms. Firms are already scouring places like Twitter to conduct sentiment analysis, and I wouldn't be surprised if niche investment communities like WSB are given much more attention after this craziness. Speed is key in finance, but it can take a while for individual investors to come together on a play like GameStop (hasn't it been a year or two since the idea was first proposed?) Firms are going to keep building out their social media scraping infrastructure, and those that do it right will be able to identify risks and address them before individuals are able to organize on a large enough scale to really punish them.</text>

    <text>Possibly yes. But you have to also realize that GameStop is still much smaller than many other companies. They are only valued at about 15 Billion after its increase. In contrast, Amazon is worth 2 trillion. Granted, they are the largest in the world, but there are many, many companies worth much more than 15 billion. GameStop isn't even close to listed on the S&amp;P500. Theoretically, you could sell a tiny fraction of the S&amp;P500 and more than double GameStops market cap</text>

    <text>Because they have a short position they stand to make the most if the value of shares fall and them buying the shares will increase the value of them no matter how low the price is. With shares like this it’s not a zero-sum game, so by buying the shares they’re not limiting the amount of shares retail investors can buy so all buying up shares would do is increase the price further when the market opens which will lead to more retail buying which will push the price up even more. I hope this made sense, English is my first language I’m just bad at it</text>

    <text>Shares can be borrowed because its a great way for brokerages to make money. Bob the stockholder has his shares with the brokerage. Jim wants to borrow the shares and sell them hoping the market goes down. The brokerage gives Jim the shares that Bob owns. They don't tell bob though. As far as Bob knows his shares are in his account. The brokerage charges Jim a fee every day for those shares that he borrowed.


Some people say that shorting is helpful. When the market starts to crash, people with short positions will start buying shares because that is how they make profit (instead of buy low and sell high its sell high then buy low). This can help correct a market that is in freefall. At least, so they say.</text>

    <text>The incentive is the lender receives a fee for what is usually a pretty safe transaction. The practise is called securities lending. 

A lot of investors just hold on to their stocks for the long run. Hedge funds, and other market participants will want to borrow a stock for shorting. So if you were just going to keep your stock locked away, and someone has asked to borrow it for a few days with an obligation to give it you back then why not!? 

The borrower (hedge fund) hands something over to the lender to keep as collateral (think pawn shop) just in case. When the thing you’ve lent starts moving in value, you ask the borrower for more collateral on a daily basis. In the whole the transactions are safe with minimal credit risk, when things start moving quickly then things can start to unravel!</text>

    <text>Share price, combined with number of total shares, determine the market cap of the company.

    <text>Back in 'ye olden days, the stock market was done with real people doing a lot of trading between each other on stock trading floors.

These people can't trade 24/7, that's nuts. These people need to eat, sleep, and all that other fun human stuff. So the stock exchanges set hours of market operation.

This doesn't restrict trading after hours, but less people will be trading since everyone's gone out for the end of the day.

This concept carried over to computerized stock trading.

Brokers will allow you to trade after hours, but you need to be of a certain clientele. If you're not one of the brokers themselves or another big player, you're pretty much restricted to trading while the market is open.</text>

    <text>I think I've garnered a reasonable understanding of how shorts work, but the thing that isn't clear to me is what the benefit for the lender is.

As I understand it, the Shorter borrows stocks from a Lender, presumably at some form of interest, sells them, and then banks on the stock going down so he can buy them back more cheaply to return them. This seems rather disadvantageous to the Lender, unless the Lender is reasonably confident that the Shorter is wrong in their assessment of the market.

Is this just a zero sum game in which the Shorter and Lender are basically betting against each other? or is there some other benefit to the Lender that I am missing?</text>

    <text>If you own stock I can borrow it from you, and then sell it back to you and then borrow it again. We can repeat this Indefinitely and in theory I would owe more stocks then are available to you. And in a way you would own the one actual share+the shares that you loaned out to me, which is more than 100%.</text>

    <text>You usually need to post collateral, so that will be liquidated and given to the lender.

There are trading desks at banks called stock loan desks! They’ll go to a big mutual fund, borrow it at X% and loan it back out at X+Y%, making that “spread between borrow and loan.” Instead of providing liquidity in buying a security, they provide liquidity in borrowing them</text>

    <text>To address the second question, the rights of ownership are transferred to the borrower, who is then free to sell it. The lender of the stock knows that at some point they'll (most likely at least) get ownership of their stock back, so they're not too concerned with what the borrower does with it in the meantime.</text>

    <text>That's not entirely accurate. And I'd consider it a poor example. The share price that you see is whatever the last share sold for. Let's say you want to buy 100 GME tomorrow. You put an order in and say "gimmie market value bby". The ticker price is 300 at the moment.

Now let's say there's 4 sellers, and they have 10 shares for sale at 300. 10 at 305. 30 at 310. And 50 at 320.

Your order will now buy you 10 shares at the 300 price, 10 at the 305, etc etc. Until you have acquired 100 shares. The price on the ticker was 300 when you put your but order in, but the final price of the stock will be 320 on the ticker. you purchased your shares ranging from 300-320 because that was the 100 cheapest shares for sale at the time. Your order moved the ticker price up 20 dollars.

Now let's say you want to sell one hundred shares of a stock. You don't care the price, you just want em gone now. You put the sell order into the broker and they find buy orders for 100 shares of your stock that is offering the most, then executes it. You will sell a few stocks for the current listed price, some for less, some for even less, etc until all hundred shares are liquidated. Whatever that last share sold for is the new ticker value of the stock.</text>

    <text>Available shares doesn't include insider holdings and other shares that are hard to sell.  So if the public owns 10,000,000 shares of a company with 5,000,000 borrowed, and the founder owns another 20,000,000 shares, and someone borrows 5,000,000 of his shares, the short to float is (5,000,000 plus 5,000,000) over 10,000,000 or 100% not 30,000,000 (because 20 million of the shares don't really trade).</text>

    <text>When you short a stock, what you’re doing is borrowing shares from someone else, selling them and then planning to buy them back and return them to the lender. So say borrowed 70% of GameStop’s shares and sold them, you can then, in theory, borrow them from the guy you just sold them to and do the same thing. When the time period ends, you’ll have to buy back stock to return them, so you’ll basically have to buy the stock, return them and then buy back some of those same shares and return those.</text>

    <text>Absolutely. It's guaranteed to hurt normal people.

I also guarantee you that billionaires are extremely familiar with what position to engage to profit from the economic destruction created by this bubble. Not every investor had GameStop stock and not every investor took an initial short position on GameStop. Bundling the term "Wall Street" with "these people who took this initial position" is quite silly and just seems like a branding for some anti-billionaire crusade. Those same billionaires who lost are certainly attempting to gain from the same situation days afterwards.

It should not impact pensions, 401(k), etc.</text>

Should you? I don't know, what do you think? If you buy it tomorrow, do you think you can sell it for a profit in the future? If yes, then yes you "should" buy it. If no, then you "shouldn't" buy it.

    <text>Yes. It's sub 200 rn, be on your trading platform with a livestream ticker on another screen at open. If you can put in a buy order, do it, otherwise wait till open and buy as much as possible while it's in a sub 250 dip. Even up to and beyond 300 and you'll still make a profit, you just may as well get it as cheap as possible</text>

    <text>&gt; But could this be hurting peoples pensions, modest investments, 401ks etc.

Indirectly, I think so.  Say a hedge fund (or many) is forced to liquidate billions of dollars of stocks to cover the shorts, then that could cause stock prices to dip around the world.

If that money they just spent goes back into the stock market except in new owners hands, then I don't think it'd be more than a hiccup.  But that money could be going to main street instead of wall street -- people buying cars, paying off student loans, paying off mortgages, etc.  That money probably ends up going right back to wall street eventually regardless, but it could be... delayed.  

Then again, if the fed decides to raise interest rates (totally unrelated to the shenanigans right now, just an example), that'd also cause stock prices to fall, which could also affect 401ks, etc.  That's the nature of the beast, ya know?</text>

    <text>Basically someone noticed that GameStop was heavily shorted and realized that a short squeeze would happen that would heavily inflate the price so they essentially made a bet that the price would go up. Shorting a stock means someone contractually locks themselves into selling a stock at a certain price except the problem is that they haven’t bought it yet and will buy it later on at a certain date. During this window they hope the stock price will go down so they can buy it cheap then sell it at the price they agreed to. The problem is that the aggregate amount that would be contractually bought later on is greater than the actual shares available, this is where the short squeeze happens. Since these people shorting the stock are forced to buy the stock so they can fulfill their deal, they’re forced to buy whatever quantity they agreed to at whatever price is available. As more and more of these purchases happen, the less quantity available and the higher the price will go. Since there’s literally not enough shares available for these shorts, the price can basically rocket to the thousands. This is why the peeps over at wsb are telling everyone to not sell because that would put shares back into circulation for the shorts to buy which will lower the price. As long as wsb holds, the price will continue to skyrocket.</text>

So opposite situation would be if most people want to sell their basketballs then they would have to sell it at a cheaper price than other sellers which forces other sellers to further reduces the price and it becomes cheaper and cheaper. Correct?

    <text>Short selling in a nut shell: When you buy a stock, you do it in the hopes that the value of the stock you bought will increase, so you can sell it for a profit. Value of the stock goes up, you sell and make money. Short selling works the other way around, if the value of the stock drops, you make money.

I know, you might be asking yourself what kind of sorcery is this, let me explain.

When short selling, you “borrow a stock” (yeah, I said borrow, you don’t buy it), for a period of time, let’s say 10 days. As soon as you “borrow” the stock you have to sell it, let’s say you sell that borrowed stock at $10. When the time comes to give back the stock you “borrowed”, you must buy back the stock. If the value of the stock dropped to $8, you use the $10 you got when selling it 10 days ago, and keep the $2 difference to your self. Price dropped, you made money. What if the stock prices increased to $13? In that case, sad news for you, you will have tu put an extra $3 to buy the stock back, and therefore loosing money.</text>

    <text>Trading is like saying "I trust a company, I buy a small piece of it"  so if in the future that company value goes up you and the company gain money. This is called long trading. Short trading is when you promise to sell a stock before actually bying it. So if you "promise" to sell now, let's say at 10 and the company goes down you, will get 10 by actually spending 5. Big investors (hedge fund) usually trade short, by targeting a slow value company and trying to make it bankrupt (sometimes with not so pleasant methods). The stock value goes up when lot of people trust a company (by buying a stock) and goes down when people sell a stock (not trusting any more a company). What is actually happening is that big investors put a lot of money on the bankrupt of GameStop by selling, so lowering the price. A lot of users decided to buy such an economic stock leading the stock value to rise a lot. That made big investors loose money and cry a lot. This could be just a curious eventi if the main brokers (the one that manage the stock trading for people) decided to forbid trading actions, in simple words, protecting big investors.</text>

    <text>There's no way to know what their ''top'' price is, often when an all time high is reached, it will go up more due to momentum.

Shareholders sell their stocks to buyers, if there's not enough buyers, the price goes down until someone buys them. I'm not sure who they sell it to while buying is disabled on Robinhood, perhaps hedgefunds or perhaps Robinhood was buying them themselves.</text>

    <text>Here's my explanation that I told to a friend.

There's a way called "shorting" to profit off of dying companies.

(Consider + as profit and - as loss)

Short Procedure:
1. Borrow a stock that is expected to drop. ( - small borrow fee)
2. Sell it for current price. ( +Original stock price)
3. Wait for it to drop.
4. Buy it back much cheaper. ( -dropped price)
5. Then return the stock to the owner.
Total Profit = original stock price - dropped price - borrow fee

 Risk: If the company's stock rises instead of falling, you will sustain losses.
 Loss = Inflated Price + Borrow Fee - Original Price.
 This is hence considered a risky practice.
 
Back to the story,
In lockdown GameStop was suffering major losses and it's stocks were dropping, so many big businesses and a large number of people decided to short it.

If you look back at the short procedure, there's a long waiting period.

The status at this waiting period is that you owe the original owner one stock. (The stock you borrowed and then sold and are now waiting for it's price to drop)

Now suppose another person wants to short GameStop.
This person may borrow the stock that you just sold, from the person that you just sold it to. (In other words, this person will borrow one stock from the person who brought one stock from you).

Notice the problem here.
There only one stock, but there are two people who owe someone that stock.
In other words, two people think they own a stock but there's only one stock available to own.
Soon, there will be more people who owe a stock to someone, than the total stocks that are there.

This happened to GameStop, where 140% of it's stocks were sold as short. But there's not enough stocks for this many people to own.

Now imagine the stock price goes up instead of down, (say the company did something great), people will panic and try to buy back the stocks they sold so as to not sustain losses. (Why do they buy back? Because they need to return the stock to the owner.)
But there are not enough stocks to go around. This will increase the demand of stocks and supply will be short, further increasing it's price, this cycle will continue and the stock price will keep on increasing because of the high demand and low supply. Note that this didn't happen yet.

(Btw why are there not enough stocks? Imagine the story earlier, after noticing the rise in price, you decide to buy back the stock, but instead of asking the person you sold to, you ask the person currently owning the stock, now you return the stock to the original owner and you're relieved, but what about the person you sold the stock to the first time? There was only one stock which has returned to it's owner, there's still one guy who owes someone a stock and one guy who thinks he owns one stock.)

Now comes reddit,

Note: If many people buy a particular stock, it's price will increase because of the increased demand and shortened supply.

The small investors on r/wallstreetbets decided to take advantage by buying GameStop's stocks and increasing the stock price, this will start the chain I explained just now, where the people who have shorted will buy back to avoid losses, but due to the lack of stocks, it's price will further increase, and more people will pull out of the short and the price will increase again, and so on.

Before lockdown, the stock price was $4 apiece. Recently it reached $147, and one day later $345. The price is skyrocketing.

The big investors and billionaires that decided to short and take advantage are losing money in billions, while the small investors are making loads of money.

But GameStop is not as valuable as it's stock price, so this inflating bubble will burst, and the prices will crash.
When this happens, if you invest by looking at the rising prices,  you will lose a lot of money, but you can profit if you short at the correct time.

Sigh.</text>

    <text>If you want to make money in stocks, you follow the old adage: **Buy Low, Sell High**. Thus if the stock goes up in price, you have made a profit (and if the stock goes down in price, you lose money). ~~This is called a~~ **~~LONG~~** ~~position.~~

&amp;#x200B;

Greedy motherfudgers in Wall St. derived a second way of making money: **Sell High, Buy Low**. No need to get into the particulars, but it just means that if the stock goes down in price, you have made a profit (and if the stock goes up in price, you lose money). This is called shorting. 

&amp;#x200B;

A bunch of richy rich people made a **short on Gamestop**, meaning that they were hoping the price goes down. On the other hand, people on r/wallstreetbets started **buying stocks on Gamestop**, hoping that the prices go up.

&amp;#x200B;

But it's a wee bit more than that, if you short a stock you actually start decreasing its price (**increase supply**) and if you buy a stock you actually start increasing its price (**increasing demand**).

&amp;#x200B;

Thus a tug of war happened, between **rich motherfudgers on Wall St.** and **poor motherfudgers on Reddit**. So far, it's seem that Reddit is winning (yay we did it guys!) but only time will tell the long term ramifications of this.

    <text>Wall St got caught with it's dick in a cookie jar, and a naked boy next to them.

Now, there's nothing really illegal about having your dick in a cookie jar. It's odd, and probably bad, and embarrassing when you get caught, and you've got to pay for the cookies and the cookie jar and maybe a bit extra.

The naked boy, however, everyone should be paying attention to. That's probably super illegal.

Congress and the media are yelling at the people who caught Wall St. with their dick in the cookie jar.

-------------------------------------------------


Financially: Hedge funds saw GameStop was failing, bet that the stock would fail, and the company would go bankrupt. Let's say they bet ~10 billion dollars on this and expected to make 12 billion, made up numbers.

Well, GameStop has a lot of Brick real estate, PC hardware is in demand and needs shelf space, and their new CEO is from Chewy and knows how to cater to a large, but "niche" crowd.

People like the stock. Bought it.

Price went up. 

Hedge funds started owing 11 billion. Then 12 billion. Now they owe 70 billion on a bad bet they made.</text>

    <text>basically some people over in /r/wallstreetbets found out that gamestop was a heavily short sold stock (usually done by hedge funds) and they became pissed at how hedge funds get away with "gaming" the market and decided to stick it to the hedge funders.  so you lose money when you short a stock if the stock's price goes up.  so all the wallstreetbets people rallied together and kept buying gamestop, which lead to a frenzied rally of gamestop once more and more people saw the momentum.  this causes people who shorted gamestop to lose a lot of money.</text>

    <text>GameStop was a heavily shorted company. In fact, through the use of options, hedge funds and other speculators had amassed a short interest in the company larger than the total amount of stock in the company. This created a precarious position for those short sellers, which /r/wallstreetbets was able to capitalize on. By alerting its users to the excessive short interest, and by providing a not-so-compelling thesis for why the stock should be worth more than its share price suggested, they were able to convince thousands or maybe tens of thousands of individuals to buy the stock. This buying frenzy caused the stock price to rally (go up) rapidly, putting pressure on anyone holding a short position. In order to exit a short position, you have to buy back the shares you've sold short. This buying, on top of continued buying by the retail investor community, caused a self-reinforcing cycle which drove the price of GameStop to enormous heights.

This had the immediate effect of causing the hedge funds which were short GameStop to incur significant losses. One hedge fund, Melvin Capital, suffered such significant losses that they sought rescue financing from another hedge fund, Citadel. In response to the excessive volatility of the stock, many online brokers stopped allowing customers to make buy orders.

What fewer people understand is that the new-age brokerage apps, like Robbinhood, aren't like traditional brokers. When joe blow buys $10 worth of some stock, Robbinhood doesn't turn around and go to market for them. It would be a waste of time and effort for an amount that small. Instead, they utilize third party market makers to act as middle-men who facilitate these transactions. Because the platform is largely catering to small investors, the sum of millions of little trades generally more or less offsets itself. You buy a few shares of Apple, someone else is probably selling them at the same time, and so the market-makers are able to manage that flow (and take a cut) without really having to actually assign shares. In this situation, however, Joe Blow's $1000 investment in GameStop is now worth $50,000. Multiply that by a few tens of thousands of users and you've created a potentially catastrophic level of risk sitting between the broker and the market-maker. So, Robbinhood's market-makers forced them (and others) to stop trading.</text>

    <author>the_friendly_skeptic</author>
    <text>Hopefully this is helpful. I work in the stock market and my little brother asked me to explain what was going on. Here was my response:

Okay I’m off work now so I can focus.

Let me try it this way:

Let’s say GameStop has 100 shares outstanding currently trading @ $20 per share (so if you own 1 share, you own 1%, 25 shares = 25% and so on)

That’s it. There are only 100 shares of GameStop. Throughout the day people are constantly buying and selling these shares for one reason or another (that’s why the stock price moves up and down constantly)

Now, typically when you think about making money in the stock market you typically think “buy low, sell high” 📈. In other words, buying Amazon when it was cheap, and now it’s worth 💰 💰 💰. In this case you would be speculating that the stock price of Amazon will go up ⬆️ in the future fun industry term: you are  “bull-ish”

Here is where the short selling comes into play.

Let’s pretend You have a hedge fund. Alec’s hedge fund manager looks at GME (GameStop) and says “I think GME is over valued, it really should only be trading at $15 per share, not $20 🤔 “

In this situation, He is speculating that in the near future, the GME stock price will go down (to $15).

another fun industry term; he would be “bear-ish” on GME

Now since the hedge fund manager thinks GME’s stock price will go down, He is going to try to make money on that guess by short selling (shorting) the stock.

To short the stock The manager is going to borrow some shares from someone else, bob, and sell them at the current market price (which is $20).

Let’s say he borrows 10 shares (total of only 100 remember) and sells them at the New York stock exchange for $20. He made $200 ($20 x 10 shares)

A while later, GMEs stock price suddenly dips (fun industry term: “down ticks”). It is now trading at $15.

Alec’s hedge fund manager was right! now don’t forget, we borrowed the shares from somebody else so we have to give those back. Alec’s hedge fund manager goes to the New York stock exchange and buys 10 shares @ $15 and returns those to the lender.

Alec’s hedge fund made $50 on that trade total (this is called “PnL”).

So the full life cycle:

•	⁠Borrowed 10 shares from “bob”                         
•	⁠Sold 10 @ $20 in the market.                   
•	⁠Bought 10 @ $15 in the market.              
•	⁠Returned 10 shares to “bob”

Total profit = (10 x $20) - (10 x $15)

Okay.... so now onto what is actually happening with GameStop.

Let’s keep the example the same. GameStop has 100 total shares outstanding.

Now a bunch of hedge fund managers all think the exact thing that Alec’s hedge fund manager thought  so they all short the stock with the expectation that the price will “downtick” in the future.

Here’s the thing.... someone on Reddit pointed out that despite the fact that GameStop only has 100 shares available at any given time, there were actually 125 shares on loan to cover short sales.

I know this part is confusing, which it should be. That doesn’t make sense mathematically. How can you have more shares loaned out than available? I’m going to gloss over those details and just say that it is possible, and does happen on occasion.

Now when you have a stock that is over shorted like this, you have one major risk, which is called a “gamma/short squeeze” . It does not occur often.

In a gamma/short squeeze, there are more shares loaned out than available. That is because all of those hedge fund managers thought the price would go down and got greedy and tried to make as much 💰 as possible and over borrowed assuming they would be able to cover it. But, someone pointed that out on Reddit, and was able to get that information to go viral. Now with all of these new people buying the stock, it forced the stock price up, very quickly (supply and demand).

Just like in the example, these hedge fund managers had to return the shares to the lender... the problem is, the stock price has gone up so much that if they have to “close their position” they’ll lose a fortune.

Example: I sold 10 @ $20 = $200

Instead of going down; the stock price went up to $400. I have to return the stock to the lender and the only way to do it is to go buy it back. So:

•	⁠I buy 10 @ $400 = $4,000
•	⁠PnL = +$200 - $4,000

instead of making money; I lost $3,800.

This is basically what is happening with GME on a much bigger scale

Edit: Lots of people asking about the “loan”. It’s not really a loan in the way that you’re thinking. When you execute an order to sell a share, you are required to Mark it as either “long” or “short”. What this really means is, do you “have” the stock right now in your bank account, or are you “able” to get it easily. So theoretically, everyone could be marking their orders as short sales, assuming the shares are easy to borrow and readily available, except, as the price goes up, people panic and start buying them all up and there aren’t enough to go around. This in turn drives the price up further. Hence the “squeeeeeeeze”

Typical settlement of a trade occurs t+2. In other words, you’re required to deliver the shares you sold short to the counter party within two business days of execution

Edit2 for those asking about option expiration:

An option as like a coupon. It gives the coupon holder the right to buy or sell stock, at a given price, on a given date.

Think about it this way. If I think that the stock price of GME is going to go up in the near future, I can buy a coupon (technically a call option) that gives me the right to purchase the stock for a set price at a later date. So if GME is @ $20, I may buy a call option that gives me the right to buy GME stock for $20 per share exactly one month from now (expiration). The idea is that within that time frame; the gme stock price will increase, thereby making my coupon valuable because it allows the owner to buy at a discount.

On the other side, you have someone who “writes” the contract. Essentially sells you the coupon. Let’s say GameStop is trading at $20, and you buy that $20 coupon. Well now, GameStop is trading at $400. So if your expiration is tomorrow you can “exercise” it, and the writer is required to deliver your shares for the agreed upon price, $20. To do that, they’ll probably have to go out and buy it at these exorbitant prices</text>

    <text>Basically a whole bunch of investors made a bet that the GME share price would fall. The did what is called a “short sale”, basically borrowing GME shares and selling them, and hoping to buy them back at a lower price in the future. It’s essentially “buy low, sell high” in reverse.

What happened though is that they made this bet over and over, to the point when more than 100% of the outstanding shares was borrowed in some way. Think of this way - Person A lends a share of GME to Person B, who sells it to Person C. Person C then lends it to Person D, who sells it to Person E. Only one share is moving around, but both Person B and Person D need to buy a share in the future to return it.

People (including the folks on wallstreetbets) noticed that this had happened, and realized that if lots of people need to buy back GME shares to return the shares in the future, they can buy it now and make money in the future when the short sellers need to repay their loans.

The issue is that there are way more “loans”that need to be repaid with GME stock than GME stock available, so that naturally has pushed the price up.</text>

    <text>Price is determined by transactions.  Essentially, person A sells a share to person B for 100 dollars.  This transaction is logged with all other transactions of the particular stock (obviously at much higher quantities in short times frames) to track the average price over a given timeframe.</text>

    <text>In an as neutral and concise as possible manner, and I may have missed some things.

Gamestop is seen as a company in trouble.  Their business model of brick and mortar stores for game sales and rental is under pressure due to people using downloads instead more and more etc. Etc.

This was picked up on by some hedge funds who thought that the company would face bankruptcy in the near future, which would render their shares effectively worthless.  So they bet against Gamestop by shorting their shares.

Shorting shares is the practice of borrowing shares, selling them, waiting for the price to go down, buying them back at a lower price when that happens and giving them back to the lender.  Its buy low - sell high, in reverse order.  Rather than betting a stock will rise by buying it now and plan to sell later when it's worth more, you sell now and plan to buy later when the price is lower. 

Then two things happened: Gamestop reorganised.  New CEO, closed the worst stores, effectively tried to become smaller but more importantly profitable again.  Two: the internet, notably WSB picked up that an enormous amount of Gamestop shares were sold short, to the tune of 120% of available shares currently.

Now two important things come into play.  1) when you borrow a share the contract will specify a date by which it must be returned.  2) When you buy a stock the most you can lose is the value of the share.  You buy shares for 1 million, company goes bankrupt, share becomes worthless, you lost your million.  You cannot possibly lose more.  When you go short however...  if you short sell 1 million worth of shares, your potential loss is unlimited.  If the value of those shares tripled to 3 million you now owe 3 million worth of shares to the lender.  If it triples again to 9 million you now owe 9 million worth of shares.  Short selling is inherently risky that way.

In comes WSB.  They figure that maybe if enough people can be convinced to buy GME stock, first the price will naturally rise if enough people want to buy, and secondly well one day those short sellers will be FORCED to buy them at market price and if a lot of them have to do so the price should rise spectacularly because the short sellers MUST buy.

GME stock indeed started to rise.  Spectacularly so.  Worth 10usd a few months ago it went up to 384 yesterday.  GME is worth 13.5 billion right now.  It was worth more like 0.5 billion a few months ago.  With the company having been short sold 1.2 times, that means there are red numbers on the short sellers books right now for about 15 billion dollars.  If they effectively do need to return a large amount of borrowed shares simultaneously they will need to buy them driving the price even further up and every % the share price goes up, that 15 billion in the red also goes up by about 1%.

I will not speculate on what will happen further but the biggest similar thing I've seen happen when I worked in that world, was a somewhat similar scandal in 2005 were a single bank lost around 220 million in a single day.  Heads, big heads rolled then.

I am honestly anxious to see what the future will bring with all this...

EDIT: I won't edit the above so the many comments keep making sense.

First of my thanks for the many replies, awards and upvotes.  Especially those comments that pointed out some mistakes and inaccuracies in the above.

Secondly, the CEO did not change but Gamestop did attract a number of new board members who were pivotal in turning another company in a similar situation (needing to transition from brick and mortar to much much more online) around.  This obviously gives hope that Gamestop could possibly be turned around and be profitable again as well.

Thirdly.  I assumed that lending contracts had expiry dates (just like options trades) because of r/WSB insisting that today is a pivotal date in all this.  I was mistaken, as it turns out Lending and Borrowing is only limited by collateral put up, not by expiry dates.  Lending and Borrowing is not a part of the exchange I specifically worked on, options and futures were my niche.  A part of the puzzle I missed is that apparently those same and/or other hedge funds betting against Gamestop also wrote a lot of uncovered call options (the more traditional way of betting against a company) and those DO (or at least some do) expire today, which is where the squeeze for specifically today comes from.  This means that the closing price for GME tonight US time will be extremely important in how all of this shakes out.  The higher it closes, the more massive the carnage wil be.  This thing is even more high stakes than I at first suspected it turns out.</text>

    <text>Just because something “feels bad” doesn’t make it or should make it illegal. 


While the current events WILL result in legislation, they will not ban shorting. 


There are also activists shorters, who like other answers have mentioned, keep shady corporations from manipulating their own stock, as happened with Enron and the subprime mortgage backed securities crisis.</text>

    <text>If shit hits the fan and they are not able to close short possitions, then broker (like IB or Robinhood) has to cover those possitions. If they are not able to do that then clearing house has to do it. If they can't do that, then DTCC has to do it. And if they can't do it, then either QA and printers go bzzzzz or stock market breaks.</text>

    <text>100% what people think it is worth. The stock market is entirely based on peoples feelings. No one sees all the millions and billions changing hands willy nilly. If everyone cashed out all their stocks in everything there would not be enough cash to cover it all.  Or the stock would be worthless which means money just vanishes

    <text>Yes. If the Melvin Hedge Fund loses their entire capital they would file for bankruptcy. That’s unlikely, but not impossible. 

Yes. It’s possible that the people (read large banks most likely) who lent shares to Melvin may not get them back. 

One of the comments below mentions collateral for the lent shares. That’s true - but slightly misleading. The amount of collateral posted will be calculated based on “normal” share price moves. Obviously, the recent moves are much larger than normal. It’s not guaranteed, or even really likely, that the collateral is enough to cover Melvin’s losses.</text>

It's likely Melvin has closed their position and has staved off bankruptcy, but we will know for sure in less than 24 hours</text>

    <text>From what i, a 23 year old who barely paid attention in Econ/Gov senior year, remember is that people can invest in companies and the amount that we invest is the total value of what its worth. I’m probably wrong but I think its like the amount of investors or shares divided by the amount of money invested? 

If you and i both pay $5 for 1 share to Candy Bar then I think the money its worth is $10. So its multiplication at that point. Then the candy bar endorses Good Cause and makes a bunch of people want to buy the stock so the value of it goes up. Supply and demand. Its worth more bc its more desirable. News comes out that Candy Bar did Bad Thing and now no one supports the business, ppl sell before it drops too low, value goes down. Everyone hates Candy Bar and they lose a lot of money now they are worth less than $10 and the company struggles to survive. 

I’m definitely not qualified to answer the question and answering you has made me realize this, so I’m really happy this megathread is here. Hopefully someone has given you an answer by the time I’m done writing this!</text>

    <text>A hedge fund would have other positions they could liquidate to cover the short.  The crux of this is that would likely cause them to cease functioning as a business I.e. bankruptcy.</text>

    <text>The hedge fund has borrowed shares to sell. In order to borrow those shares, the hedge fund had to pay a cash deposit to the lender of those shares in case they don't return the shares for whatever reason (like leaving your credit card number with a car hire company). The hedge fund also has to keep topping up the deposit with more cash whenever the share price rises so that the deposit is always enough to cover the value of the shares they've borrowed. If the price keeps rising, eventually the hedge fund will run out of cash and won't be able to top up the deposit. At that point, the lender of the shares will be allowed to terminate the share loan and will keep the cash deposit instead of getting the shares back. This removes the short position from the market. 

Crucially, in order to close out the short position, the hedge providers do not actually have to buy any GME shares. They just have to sacrifice their cash deposit. This is the gaping hole in the WSB plan that they don't understand. If they succeed, they may bankrupt the hedge fund, but the hedge fund will not actually buy their shares. Instead of returning the shares to the lender, the hedge fund just pays a lot of cash to the lender.

Once the short position has been removed (which could happen instantaneously at any moment) the GME share price will crash and those WSB investors who are still holding GME shares will be ruined. So the upshot is that they can bankrupt the hedge fund, but the hedge fund's money will not go to the WSB investors, it will go to the share lender. The only WSB investors who profit will be those who sell to other WSB investors before the inevitable crash.</text>

    <text>This is over simplified, but they essentially had to post collateral to borrow the GME shares to short. As the price kept going up, they should have had to, in theory, post more collateral. I don’t know how much of their total assets the short position represents, but basically they would have to sell other assets to fund the repurchase. 

In theory the people that lent them the GME shares would call in all their collateral before it ever got to a “bankruptcy” situation.</text>

    <text>People only sell “shares” when they need to raise capital from others to grow the business.  That’s because the owners don’t have enough capital, so they “share” ownership of the business in exchange for that capital investment.

Private companies don’t typically offer “shares” at least not publicly traded ones.   Only public companies have public shares that are tradeable and transferable...</text>

    <text>Right, let's see if I can explain this. Obligatory am not a stock broker, so please take what I say with a grain of salt, and I definitely welcome any corrections for things I get wrong.

-----

##Stocks and Shares

Let's say you have a company called CORP, and that company has a board of directors. Now CORP wants to become publicly traded, so they announce that they will sell one seat on the board for $20. Alice hears of this and thinks that's a pretty good deal, so pays them the money and now gets a small say in what the company does and in return CORP gets a little bit of extra money. This seat is a **share** in the company, which can be traded in something called the **stock market** (where people can buy and sell their stock in a company). 

Now as the years go on, CORP becomes a global company and now everyone wants to be at the table. Suddenly Alice's seat becomes really valuable. If Alice wants she can sell her seat for $100 now, or keep her seat and hope that CORP does better and sell it for more later on. Even though right now Alice doesn't have any more money in her wallet than she did originally, she is still worth more money because the seat she owns is now worth more. 

Importantly, when Alice does sell her seat, even if she sells it for $1000, CORP doesn't actually get any of that money - they already sold the seat to Alice a long time ago for $20. However, later on CORP might apply for a loan, and the broker might look at the price of the seats at their table (their **share price**). If the price is really high, that must mean the company is doing well for themselves so the loan is more likely to be approved. Also, if anyone ever owns more than half of the seats at the table, then that person also effectively owns CORP. So CORP really wants the price of their seats to stay high. 

##Short Selling

So what if CORP starts doing poorly? Well Bob 'Shorty' McScrooge might see this and see an opportunity to make money off of CORP's losses. So what he does is he goes to Alice and asks her if he can borrow her seat. She reluctantly says yes, as long has he promises to give it back in a month. He takes this seat and sells it to Joe for $100. As the days pass, the price of a seat at CORP goes down. When the end of the month comes around, Shorty buys another seat back, but now that the price has gone down he only has to pay $20 (meaning he effectively made $80 since he originally sold the seat for $100). 

Let's say now that after Shorty borrowed Alice's seat and sold it, CORP finds gold and now everyone wants to buy a seat again. Well now Shorty is in real trouble. At the end of the month, he still owes Alice her seat back, but now seats cost $1000 to buy. If Shorty can't find a way to make the seats cheap again, then he might go bankrupt.

---

## GameStop

This is pretty much what happened with GameStop (aka GME). They were doing really poorly and their share price was going down, so lots of billionaires borrowed stock (seats) and sold them, expecting the price to drop resulting in them making even more money at the cost of GME. Reddit realised this so bought all the stocks causing the price to soar, meaning the billionaires are going to have to spend lots of money to buy back their borrowed seats (costing them billions of dollars). Of course, losing billions of dollars is something billionaires would very much like to avoid. 


##  Robinhood App

Robinhood is an app used by a lot of everyday people to trade stocks, and was the tool used by a lot of redditors to make GME's share price get so high. No matter what the billionaires did, more and more redditors started using Robinhood to buy more GME stock, causing the prices to get even higher (meaning the billionaires would have to pay *even more* to return their borrowed seats). So to try to drive the price down, Robinhood said it would no longer let people buy GME stock, and that they could only sell now (remember, the seats at the table are only worth something if people are able to buy them). This is illegal and has been widely criticised by US representatives from both parties as well as basically everyone who isn't a billionaire.

    <text>Should also note that it depends on how the short sellers structure their company. Melvin Capital, for example, operates as a limited partnership, meaning that it has both general partners and limited partners. The limited partners are not liable for losses in excess of company assets, but general partners are.</text>

    <text>It's a deliberate move by the owners of a company to list it on a stock exchange. For example the Robert Bosch GmbH is a private company that has annual Revenue of 77 billion euros (about 93 billion in freedom money). This revenue makes it larger than IBM, Target or Boeing but it is not listed on any stock exchange.</text>

https://www.statista.com/statistics/549091/largest-private-us-companies-by-revenue/.

But if you go public, you can raise more money *(eg to expand the business, to cash out etc). You do have to disclose more information about your company and abide by other SEC regulations etc.

There are rules that you can't distribute 'shares to more than n owners if private, though</text>

    <text>Essentially yes to all your points. People who buy high are people who misjudged a price, or believe it will rise ever higher. In the market you only lose money by selling. If you buy a stock at $5 and it falls to $3, you haven’t lost money because it could potentially rise and you’ll get that $2 back. You also can only profit when you sell. Every investor struggles deeply with when to buy and when to sell, and more often than not you end up with regrets even if you make money.</text>

    <text>Until you sell the stock any gains, or losses, are only theoretical. Prices that a website, broker, etc might tell you are only a quote or guess at valuing what you own. That price is typically determined by looking at, among other things, what dollar amount other people are trading the stock at. 

In the case that you buy low and sell high, who buys it at a high price? Well, just like any other product, the buyer is someone who wants it. If you are selling something that's increased in value, maybe the buyer thinks it is still going to get more and more valuable. Maybe they don't want to miss out, and act from a place of fear. Or perhaps you as the seller just have different needs; like you have a large debt or expense and decide to use the proceeds of the stock's sale.

On the flip side, what if the value of the stock tanks? Who is buying something that's losing value? Again, people who want it. Maybe they think its going to bounce back up, maybe they are just late to the game, etc.</text>

    <text>So if you want to short a stock, you have to have a lender willing to let you “borrow” the shares in the first place, right?  If so, how come so many lenders were willing to let these hedge funds “short” GME?  The lenders are trying to make money too, right?  And the way they would make money is if the stock had gone up by the time their shares needed to be returned.


So how could these lenders have confidence that GME wouldn’t keep falling...whereas up until a few days ago it seemed like it was inevitable.


That’d be like me owning stock in phonebooks (if there is such a thing) and someone wants to short my shares because he thinks they’re gonna keep falling.  If I lend him my phonebook shares aren’t I saying “I have confidence that I am going to make money because I believe that these phonebook shares will go up and the borrower will owe me money in the end.”</text>

    <text>If you’re investing traditionally you don’t really sell your stock except a little at a time when you need cash because it tends to make far better gains than if it was sitting in a bank account or as paper under your mattress losing out to inflation. If you want low risk investment put 1/3 of your savings into spy and forget it’s there. I’m not a financial advisor though. Buy and hold gme</text>

    <text>GameStop explained - 
Remember the toilet paper shortage we went through? 
GameStop is the toilet paper. 
Melvin Capital is the price gouger who borrowed a bunch of TP from Charmin (broker) at “future” normal post-pandemic prices ($1) and sold it to the public at current prices ($5). 
Pandemic over, Melvin has to return TP to Charmin buuuuut Reddit decided Melvin bad and toilet paper good and bought all the TP forcing Melvin to buy it from them for new price of $50 or pay Charmin extra for collateral. 
Melvin’s friends got mad that Reddit acted like Melvin and they closed Charmin’s doors so Reddit couldn’t buy anymore TP. 
Now AOC and Trump Jr have joined forces and are having lunch discussing ways to punish Melvin’s friends so that Reddit can put all the toilet paper in a rocket ship.</text>

    <text>Hi, I'm  a random person on the internet that's vastly been interested in stocks for a whole week.

What does halting a stock actually have value for, in gaming terms what are the actual useful mechanics of halting a stock? It seems kind of weird to me that  "market makers" can just freeze a stock multiple times. 

I'm sure this is the most abusive way to use the power but I'm wondering if it has any actual basis or uses that aren't, forceful?</text>

    <text>The Idea is the short squeeze will be so ginormous that everyone will be able to profit. Shorts will need to close their positions eventually and if no one is willing to sell, they will need to buy shares back at higher and higher prices. This will probably not be the case because some people will always sell early and some will be greedy and hold for too long. But that is the theory.</text>

I don't understand how they would profit by doing this or why they would do this... If their plan worked and the price did go down, in the end there's still only "100" shares to buy back so how would they buy 125?</text>

    <text>The point is the stock goes up, then the company dilutes the shareholders to raise money for itself. Also executives that own the stocks can now sell higher. This is the point of the public markets, rise up then deflate to a higher baseline.

GME will do this as well, especially as a company struggling financially. This is only long-term sustainable solution. People who are ignorant of this fact, are disconnected from reality.</text>

    <text>I think that they will not get bailed out this time. Because of 2008 a lot of people still hold anger from that and a lot of dems won’t side with the banks as easily as republicans did years ago.  

Individual investors are flooding the stock market right now. Even if institutions back off their investments and start taking money out of the stock market (unlikely at current interest rates) I think a lot of money is flowing back into the market from individuals who are democratizing the stock market. The barriers to entry for your average American to invest are gone with all the new apps.  Robinhood and Reddit are now the number one and number two apps in the App Store.  

The other effect I think this will have is that these new retail investors will be policing the bad behavior of the market makers, brokers, and banks.  When they behave badly like Robinhood did yesterday, there will be huge social media backlash and calls for regulation and investigation. Hedge funds won’t be able to work in the shadows making company-destroying bets like they have for years and years.</text>

    <text>Doesn't matter if the stock is going up or down if you participate in a stock lending program it just happens when your share gets called on. You still keep the share technically. Can sell it whenever you want. You also get paid interest from the person who is borrowing the share. Companies get shorted all day every day not only when they go to zero.</text>

    <text>The brokers are not the ones shorting. The hedge funds are. They have time decay because they are paying interest (over 120%) on the stock. When you short a stock you have to borrow it and pay interest. This prevents you from holding forever and just waiting for it to dip to a price where you can buy back and profit. You are after all borrowing something so paying interest is only logical.</text>

    <text>The interest is calculated based on the current share price multiplied by the number shares borrowed (shorted). Let's say Melvin purchased $24 million worth of shares at $5, so 4.8 million shares.

Let's say the interest rate is 50%, which isn't unheard of for shorts but they probably get better rates. Anyway, let's guess they pay 50%. When they purchased at $5/share the interest was $5×0.5×4.8 million = $12 million per year ($33k/day).

Now that the share price is up around $300/share that interest is now $300×0.5×4.8 million = $720 million per year ($1.97 million/day). It's starting to really hurt them.

Plus if things get really high then the funds have to raise equity to ensure they can buy the shares back, so sell other stocks in their portfolio, affecting the general market. Or the lender wants to sell and demands their shares back and forces the fund to buy immediately at any price.

They over-extended and there aren't enough available shares to cover all the shorts, hence the squeeze and the price can rise dramatically as they repeatedly buy.</text>

    <text>When you (or a hedge fund) short a stock you borrow it for some sort of premium from someone who owns that stock under the promise to give it back to him, you then sell the stock and hope that by the time you have to give it back it's price falls and so you can buy it back for cheaper than you sold it , you give the stock back and pocket the difference.

For example let's say I have a stock of $SIA (shorthand for Sygald Is Awesome of course) which is valued today at 10$ , you go ahead and pay me 1$ to borrow it then sell it for 10$, by the time you have to give it back it's valued at 7$ so you buy it back and return it to me and you make 10$ (sale price) - 1$ (price to borrow) - 7$ (price to buy back) = 2$ , in this case you made 2$ and I can either sell my stock and only lose 2$ or hold it because I think it will bounce back to 10$ , anyway you made some money and I either made some money in the long run or at least didn't lose as much.

On the other hand if in the above example when you had to buy back the stock it was valued at 11$ then you would've made 10$ -1$ -11$ = -2$ , you would've lost money. Here's the thing though, that money you lost, you just paid it to someone else selling the stock so no money left the system overall.

In the current situation what will happen is that some funds will lose 70 billion dollars in this exchange and some other funds will earn 70 billion dollars , unless of course these funds don't have that money, in which case they"ll default on their payment and go under, the brokers that let them open those short positions will have to pay the debt and yeah there's a chance they"ll default as well, but for the most part brokers are just the middle men are quite easy to replace, so I wouldn't expect too much of a fall out.</text>

    <text>You get interest payments from the person shorting the stock.

If the price goes down, you at least made interest payments on that stock while it was being shorted.

If the price goes up, even better because the person shorting the stock now owes you even more.

It's essentially a low-risk win-win for the person holding the stock.</text>

    <text>Federal capital gains are based on your income and there are 3 brackets. 0% (no tax) if your income is less than $53,600, 15% for income between $53,600 and $469,050, and 20% if your income is greater than $469,050. Your state may tax capital gains as well.

When you file your tax return with the IRS you report your capital gains (or loses) on Form 1040. If you're using tax software like Turbotax, it will do it for you.

Assuming you are not on the board of directors of a public company, or own more than 10% of a public company, work for the SEC, been convicted of certain "white collar" crimes, or are otherwise in a position to be able to trade in inside information, you are most likely within your legal rights to trade. If you are employees with a public company and want to be extremely safe, don't trade your own companies stock as there are usually "blackout" period that limit elope trading for a say time before earnings are announced each quarter. Having a 401k, IRA, Roth IRA in no way limits your legal ability to also have a brokerage account, just make sure you keep the money separate.

Basically, assuming you are the average US citizen, it's perfectly fine for you to open a brokerage account and fund it from savings or money you have just laying around.</text>

    <text>That money does not go poof, it just goes to other people. So, maybe hedge funds get seen as risky and investments go elsewhere. Shorting serves a useful purpose popping bubbles before they get too large and burst explosively,  but it's probably over the top.</text>

    <text>A company raises money by offering stock in an Initial Public Offering, or IPO.  Once the stock is issued, the company is, for all intents and purposes, out, and it is only traded between investors on the secondary market.  (Note that a company can issue more stock later to raise money, or buy some back to reduce the amount they have to pay out to their investors in the form of dividends and/or to consolidate management power.  The latter can artificially raise the stock price, and is what the majority of recent corporate tax cuts were used for).

The company does "list all its stock," but in the secondary market, some positions allow traders to "borrow" shares.  That's what's triggering this situation: more shares have been borrowed to bet against the stock than exist to be bought if, say, Redditors came along and bought up all the supply.

Edit: forgot the second part of your question.  There are several reasons a company would be highly invested in keeping its stock price rising.  A big one is executive compensation--the bigwigs typically have their compensation closely tied to market metrics in hopes it will incentivize them to act in the best interests of the company and its investors.  A company with a strong stock price is also perceived as more credible to the press and creditors.  And another reason would be to reduce the ability of a competitor to take them over by purchasing a controlling portion of their stock.</text>

And it's probably good for the economy because these people are much more likely to spend that money, stimulating the economy. The trickle-down is finally happening.</text>

    <text>Hey, I’m not big on stocks but I know a bit and saw your post in new. Basically, if you want to borrow my stocks to short, you’ll pay me a small fee to borrow and then pay interest on that stock until you return it. I make money from doing nothing, you make money on shorting. Win win, until the shorting doesn’t work. Eventually, you’ll have to take a loss because interest doesn’t stop collecting. Hope this helps, not a big finance guy!</text>

    <text>You’ll get documents like you do for any other income.  I get mine through email. When you’re filing your taxes, you follow the instructions and put down the numbers for each box as directed, just like normal. 

You can also estimate the amount you’ll owe and pre-pay your taxes through the IRS’ website. You can find tax rates for gains and other sources of income pretty easily. When you pre-pay, it’s just like the tax taken out of your paycheque. When it comes tax season, you’ve already paid in, so you’ll only owe on anything beyond what you guessed. If you over-paid, you get a refund.</text>

    <text>The theory for gamestop is, there are so few shares available on the market, if you put someone in a position where they need to buy the share, you can drive up the price by simply having everyone refuse to sell it. Situations where someone would need to buy stock are to cover short positions and to cover in the money naked call options. Both are plentiful with gamestop.</text>

    <text>You'd need to understand what a stock is. Stock is simply a percentage of ownership in a company. Gamestop won't have any more money, they'll only be worth more money. The high value of the share is essentially the monetary value of their demand.</text>

    <text>&gt;when and in what manner do I make sure the IRS properly receives the appropriate amount of tax?

Your broker will provide tax documents to give to your tax preparer at year end. They usually come out in January for the previous year.

&gt;Am I within my legal rights to purchase and/or sell stocks on my own time and money while in possession of a Roth IRA retirement plan, 401k offered by my employer, or such like it?

Yes buying and selling stock has no bearing on your retirement plans.</text>

    <text>shorters borrow existing stock, sell it at current price, aim to buy back at lower price and return borrowed stock and pocket the difference.

the crazy thing right now is they shorted more than the total existing supply of shares. even everyone who owns shares hold and don't sell, it drives up the price due to increasing demand.

shorts can wait it out, but they are paying a premuim to borrow and eventually can be called to settle, forcing them to buy and return borrowed shares, even if at a loss.</text>

    <text>Investors who are desperate to get the GME stocks back so they can return them to the people they borrowed from. This basically boils down to "Are the fees they are paying for having the stock borrowed longer than expected more expensive than the current cost of the stocks?" Theoretically, at some point they'd go "Okay, if I don't buy the stocks back, even at the ridiculous price the fees for not returning the stock are going to eat me alive" but when that point would happen remains unclear.</text>

    <text>Normally, no the company does not make money just because their stock goes up. They could make money if they released more shares to the market when it goes up. But the market is finicky and investors can look at new stock for sale as a negative sign. So companies are careful not to just issue loads of new shares everytime their share price is up. But it does happen, and there's a process to do it and it can take some time.

Obviously, GameStop's case is far from normal. They could certainly issue new stock... but it could create a pretty nasty situation for them given the ongoing tug-of-war, especially if doing so helps short sellers. A lot of the people battling the short sellers are within Gamestop's target market; and fighting back the short sellers is giving GameStop great press, and keeping their stock price at ridiculous levels. 

The executives however are typically compensated with lots of stock so they do make money. In GameStop's case, lots and lots of money.</text>

    <text>There are a lot of incentives to pump up a stock.  The company puts out press releases worded to sound as promising as possible.  The CEO sends emails to "employees only" with hopelessly optimistic projections, knowing it will get leaked.  Pundits (who you should never listen to on stocks, seriously) prognosticate, possibly having genuine conflicts of interests or even just the basic conflict of interest that their job relies on their reputation as having picked stocks that will make gains and people tend to remember their wins and forget their losses.

Shorting is supposed to be the "magic hand of the market" correcting against people pumping up the value of a stock with propaganda beyond its "real" value.  You have the holders of the stock with an incentive to pump up the value, but you have other people willing to put their money where their mouth is and say, "I think you're full of shit, and it's only worth $LESS".  Their greed balances out the current holders' greed, and the market balances itself to truth and harmony.

    <text>The current theory behind this is that the shorts from hedge funds will have to buy your shares. A short is when they've sold shares that they don't actually own yet, and they need to own those shares by a certain date (to then give to whomever they originally sold it to). The hope being that in the future, when they do acquire those shares, the price will be lower. If the price is actually higher, than they've lost money overall. Thing is no one expects a stock to balloon from $10 to $400 in a week.

This however assumes that there's no one else willing to sell shares cheaper than you. If the shorts are able to buy all their shares at say, $420, then you're right that no one will want to buy your shares at 10k. It's because the shorts need to buy the shares, whether they want to or not, that is causing this situation.</text>

    <text>It’s both. People are buying to “stick it to the man” but also buy buying and holding that constrains supply. Demand exists inherently because of the over-shorted nature of the stock. Those who shorted will need to return the stock they borrowed, so they will have to buy stock. High demand, low supply = price goes up.

Also, there are plenty of people who also are bought in because they believe the company itself will turnaround. GameStop recently brought on Chewy cofounder Ryan Cohen. The thought is that an expert e-commerce builder could turn around the languishing brick-and-mortar GameStop. GameStop’s current valuation is actually not out of line with other e-commerce companies.</text>

    <text>In theory, shorting helps create an 'efficient market' where assets and commodities are priced efficiently. 

Also, it allows for risk-management to take place. For instance, farmers hedge their risk by purchasing futures - longs or shorts - on agricultural commodities to protect against the price of the crop they're growing going down see: https://www.alberta.ca/using-hedging-to-protect-farm-product-prices.aspx for instance - "This is what is called a perfect hedge because the final return matched the grower's original target price".

But, as I think as everyone is noticing, the way this tool is used is an entirely different story.</text>

    <text>No, but avoid using margin which is essentially a loan to use in the market. You still can't lose more than you spent on shares, but with margin  you'd be spending money that's loaned from your broker, which does need to be paid back.</text>

    <text>No, you shouldn't be imo. This is where a lot of people are going to get fucked. It's really popular now, people see how much money some people made, they go buy in, and everyone sells and it tanks. It's basically inflated. A lot of the time the super rich people will drive up the price of a stock only to sell it off later on for huge profit. It's basically manipulating the market. This time, redditers basically did the same thing back to them.

Thats great and all, but a lot of people who get in now are going to get burned HARD. People who tell you to go invest at this point just want their value to go up more. Its a huge gamble at this point.</text>

    <text>It would be very difficult, especially for small emerging companies, to make money. Especially for companies that are not profitable in the short term, like uber, youtube or netflix.
Also if you just stopped it right now a lot of people would lose a lot of money, and probably sue whoever closed it for the collective trillions of cumulative dollars circulating the market. 

There would probably be less innovation overall, and marketplaces would be dominated, even more than now, by few giants that have the funds already, and can fund themselves, leaving them with no real incentive to innovate, because no small company is going to come around with enough funding to shake the business in any way. 

Oh yeah, and a lot of pensions would just be poof, and thats a shame as well.</text>

    <text>When someone wants to short, they 'borrow' stocks from somebody else who owns them with an agreement stating the duration of this action and any restriction/fees. During this time they sell the stocks and hope for them to drop as much as possible in price so that they can buy them back cheaper and return them, putting an end to the borrowing and earning themselves the difference between the initial selling price and the final buyback one.
The thing is that you need to return them at a SPECIFIED TIME. If you sold them at 20$ per piece and you NEED to buy them back at a price of 300$, you'll gonna be losing 280$ per stock.
Of course stock traders will act sooner, they won't wait until they have such big losses, but, still, you can get the big picture.

This is an approximate and generalised explanation, not quite the scientific one.</text>

    <text>No.  You will only lose the amount you put in.  You can lose more as in “it was worth more at one point than it is now” so you see the difference as a loss 

Imagine it’s a baseball card
You buy it for $20
Turns out this card starts becoming rarer
Now it’s worth $100

It’s only worth $100 if you sell it though. 

Let’s say you hold onto it cause you think it’ll be worth even more than $100 eventually. And then for one reason or another (to simplify it), it drops down to being worth $2.  And you sell it when it’s worth $2, so you take a loss of $18 (pretty much everything you invested).

You Only technically lost $18, but many people would consider themselves losing the $100 because that’s what it peaked at and they could have gotten that for it.

TL;DR:  No. You only lose what you put in. Still, many people consider their “loss” as losing the amount it was worth at its peak while in your possession.</text>

    <text>In short, a bunch of wall street guys borrowed gamestop stocks and sold them, hoping the price would drop so they could buy them back cheaper and return them to the lender. But reddit bought a lot of those stocks and won't sell them now. So the guys who borrowed and sold them are stuck accruing interest.

Should you buy stocks? Short answer is no. You'd be paying a premium right now for something that is pretty much guaranteed to drop back down to worthless. The /wallstreetbets guys aren't trying to get rich so much as are sticking it to short sellers, so it's not going to last.</text>

    <text>I'm not an investor myself, so keep that in mind, but this is how I understand it.

You just borrowed a share from your broker (whoever lent you the stock). When you borrowed that share you and the broker decided on a date when that share would have to be returned. If you want you can hold onto that stock until the agreed-upon date. However, you wouldn't do this because you have to pay interest to the broker and if all you did was hold, all you would do is lose money.

 If you sell the stock and then refuse to buy it back or can't afford to buy it back the broker will force a close. They do this by initiating a margin call. Essentially force you to sell whatever assets you own so they can buy their stock back at no cost to the original lender. Or the broker might choose to sue you for breaking the agreement and losing their share.

If anyone who is more experienced with trading comes across this, feel free to point out any mistakes.</text>

    <text>So, a bunch of big financial firms had a plan. They saw that GameStop wasn't doing very well. Some firms made blog posts about how doomed GameStop was, trying to discourage people from buying GameStop stock. Then, they were going to borrow a bunch of Gamestop stock from other investors, and sell that borrowed stock really really fast. 

This would get other investors to go "Wait, if those big firms are selling Gamestop stock, they must have a good reason. We'll sell ours too!" and that would cause the price of the stock to drop. A lot. 

Then, their plan was to buy the stock back at the much lower price, return it to the folks they borrowed it from, and keep the money they made from selling high and buying low. So if they sold it at $50 a share, and bought it back at $10 a share, they'd make $40 on each share they borrowed, and if they borrowed enough, that'd be a ton of money. 

BUT, this was telegraphed, and a bunch of people on Reddit, specifically WallStreetBets found out. And they made a plan. If they all bought up the borrowed stock when it was sold, before the big financial firms bought it back, and then REFUSED to sell it, they could make a lot of money. See, if those firms sold it at $50 a share, and now the Redditors who bought the borrowed stocks went "Not selling it for anything less than $5000 a share, and not even that until next week", those companies who had originally planned to make money this way, are now going to lose a lot of money. They're obligated to give the borrowed stock back, which means they have to buy it back, and now that a majority of that stock is in the hands of Redditors who know that they can get a ton of money for it because it's borrowed, some big investment firms are losing billions of dollars. Their money-making plan turned into a money-losing plan, because the idea that a bunch of random people online, mostly using the "Robinhood" app that lets casual people buy, sell and trade stocks, just hadn't been a thing before.   


Some people are doing this because they want to make money at the end when it's okay to sell the stock, and get a huge return on their investment. Others are doing this mainly because they like messing with big wall street companies, either because they just like being trolls, or because they think the super rich people who run those companies deserve some punishment.   


I am not a financial advisor. But personally, I feel that it is now too late for newcomers to get involved in this situation.</text>

    <text>Two things. 
First the lending brokerage has financial collateral from the hedge fund. If the stock goes up the brokerage can ‘margin call’ and request extra collateral.  If the short comes due they brokers seize the collateral.
The other option is to continue to hold the short and keep paying interest to the brokerage in hopes it comes back down.
Short answer : the lenders take everything until they get what their owed.
And that’s how hedge funds go bankrupt.</text>

    <text>I will do my best.   The shot is basically a bet that a certain stock will fail and here is how i understand it.   You borrow shares of stock to sell at one price in hopes to buy it back at a lower price and pocket the difference.   Because you borrow these stocks you have to make an interest payment on them.   If the stock goes up you have to pay the lender something like half of what the increase is until the contract is up.

What happened is Hedge funds did this to more shares of stock than what is actually available,  people borrowed and sold them and then  let someone borrow those same shares so they could sell them too, thats how like 146% of the shares were shorted.  The problem is the price went through the fucking roof and these hedge funds were goingnto be on the hook for a lot of money since then price went up.  Because the price went up it caused a chain effect of people who beat against it to buy shares to cover their bets, which kept driving the price up. The higher the price the more it fucks over the wall street assholes who tried to kill gamestop by driving the price down. 

Now,  this morning,  Robinhood the investing app refused to let people buy more shares but they could sell.   If a lot of people sell thenm the price could drop but if more people are buying the price keeps going up.   The speculation is that robin hood worked with the hedge funds to keep the price down to mitigate the damage,  which is very illegal and shows how crooked the whole thing is.</text>

    <text>Shorting isn't sketchy at all for a few shares, you take a "loan" out for a share and later buy one stock to repay said loan or pay interest until you can. The problem is when there's too many shorts relative to the shares in circulation, which is what happened here. IMO the law poorly defined what the limit for how much a stock can be shorted is, and we hit the area where it's legal-but-not-feasible for something to be shorted this much.</text>

    <text>I’m not an expert, but the reason this is lightning in a bottle seems to be two-fold. First, Somehow the hedge funds shorted more stock than was actually available to trade, which seems to me to be difficult to do. I could use an ELi5 on that one... Second, and more importantly to me is the sheer will of the hive mind behind the movement. Normally this is a classic prisoner’s dilema. Pit two people against each other and give them two buttons. If you press the “buy” button and the other guy presses the “sell” button you lose and the other guy wins. If you both press “buy” then you both win. Nearly everyone has decided to collectively press the buy button over and over collectively winning and winning. Usually someone (large groups of people) get weak and drop out along the way. Obviously a pretty big over simplification, but this wouldn’t be possible without the WSB “apes” being diamond hands 💎🙌 and not paper hands 🧻🙌 when you pass them the ball.</text>

    <text>A short ladder is a form of market manipulation done by someone who likely already has a short position in the same stock. 


Say I was short selling GameStop at $10, meaning I’m hoping I can buy it back later for $5 and pocket the difference. 


Well all the sudden the price has gone to $50! I can’t buy my shares back at $50 because I will lose money! 

So why don’t I just short sell some at $45, then $40, then $35, then $30, all the way down to $5. Then I can cover all those expensive shorts, and still profit off my original position! 



In some cases this will work for the short seller, in this case it so far hasn’t been successful.</text>

    <text>This is an important question and there's a lot of anti-short sentiment right now, so I had to take a shot at answering it. A stock market in which every participant believes share prices should only go up and up is not a healthy or well functioning one. To counter people spreading unjustified optimism or pie-in-the-sky projections about a company, there have to be other people who are skeptical of their claims and keeping them honest. This is especially true in cases of outright fraud being committed. Stock prices are determined by buyers who believe the price will rise, and sellers who believe it's going to fall. But it's not enough for people to sell a stock they currently own because they no longer believe in it. There have to be motivated detectives trying as hard to uncover problems as the people in "long" positions trying to downplay or hide them. The basis of Capitalism is the profit motive, and the potential for a payout is what motivates short sellers to investigate potential wrongdoing or lies.

Should Enron have been allowed to get away with accounting fraud, or Valeant Pharmaceuticals been allowed to get away with a scheme to inflate drug prices, or Lehman Brothers been allowed to hide worthless mortgage assets on their balance sheet, just because some people are uncomfortable with the idea of short sellers making money from the decline in a stock price? All these companies were brought down because short sellers investigated them, and published what they found, and waited - sometimes a few minutes (Lehman), sometimes for years (Valeant) - for other people to catch on.

Short sellers, despite what Average Joe on the street may think, are necessary for an efficient and functioning market. What was happening with GME, however, was not right. No stock should be allowed to have 140% of it's float shorted. Especially not when the company was already undervalued at the time. That is just bullying, it does not contribute to market efficiency, and Melvin Capital deserved to be punished for it.</text>

    <text>Not much....  Gamestop made money when they sold those shares initially.  The trading back and forth in the market doesn't directly affect them.

If Gamestop is sitting on a bunch of shares of their own company, they could theoretically make loads of money by selling them.  That's probably heavily regulated, so I don't know what all is involved... But I doubt they could just go "hey guys, here's 100,000 shares for sale, pay me please."</text>

    <text>Because although shorts have always existed (betting against a stock driving its price down) usually stocks are shorted up to 20ish%, the pandemic on the other hand has put certain business in extremely questionable positions of loss after loss so in this case the hedge funds increased their short bets all the way up to 140%. When someone takes a bet that hard and has to double down after double down, they can lose infinitely and that’s what’s happening here.</text>

    <text>When something drops. Some people look for different things like time, price point, support/resistance lines, volume of trades, average price, some Fibonacci thing that people need out on, and some other stuff. Personally, if you’re looking into long term investing I’d advise buying depressed assets that you think will do well over the long term.      

Personally, I like midstream assets long term(2-4years no more) even if they drop 60% in a couple months(I’d buy more). This is not investment advice.</text>

    <text>It has been done before, but only by other hedge funds. In order to "squeeze a short", you have to own enough of the stock that the price is basically dictated on you, on top of having a large short, usually over 100%. This means you have to have the resources and ability to buy a large majority, if not all, of the stock. This is the first time the squeeze was done by the average person, and not a business.</text>

    <text>&gt;Admittedly, I do not have a very sophisticated understanding of this whole GameStop stock shorting situation, but if making a ton of money on the stock market is as simple as finding a stock that has been extremely shorted by hedge funds, and then getting thousands of people to put their money into it, how come this hasn’t been done earlier? 

It was done before. Check vw short squeeze. Problem is, RARELY stocks are short sold that much. And not to say orchestraing so many people buyung the stock is a very difficult feat. You cant even convince people to wear masks to protect themselves, how do you convince people to buy stocks with their life savings?

&gt; The internet has been around for decades and even r/wallstreetbets has been around for years. Why is this idea taking off now when it seems like a simple enough premise?  Am I missing something here?

Again, this strategy is not new. It waa found last year mid 2020, just happened when Gamestop changed CEO and shitron research try to manipulate market by social media post. It would have ended easy but the hedge fund decided to fight harder, and they now die harder</text>

    <text>From another user:

The neighbor puts a For Sale sign on his Camaro. Imagine you and a couple buddies wanted to buy it. He says he wants $6,000. Your buddy says to you loudly, “How about $4K and I just sell you mine?” You say sure! (But you don’t actually buy). Next day, you approach your other buddy and say loud enough for the neighbor to hear, “Aww man, Camaros are shit.. can you take this off my hands for $3K?” He grudgingly agrees, but no cars change hands. Two days later you approach your neighbor and say, “$6K.. man, that’s crazy. One just sold for $3K. How about $2500?” He heard the other sales numbers and thinks, “maybe this isn’t worth what I thought it was.” And boom! You convinced that dumb neighbor his tendies were stale.</text>

    <text>I won't claim to be an expert, but I spend a lot of time on WSB and have gotten familiar with their reasoning. The main reason it hasn't been done earlier is because hedge funds shorting a stock to the degree they have with GameStop is uncommon. They shorted 130% of available shares (read: they promised to buy back more shares than even existed). Also, this was the perfect storm of (loveable) idiots, disposable income (i.e. stimulus checks + Christmas money from mommy and daddy), and a love for the meme. Gamestop is a failing company regardless of the market's attempts to short them, so the beginning gents went into this knowing it was a zero sum game.
Now that Robinhood and Wall Street have reacted so strongly, it's become a matter of principle: essentially a modern Occupy Wall Street. People are buying through any broker that will allow them to and holding onto their shares with white knuckles. One guy lost out on $10 million in potential profit because he held onto his stocks before Robinhood suspended $GME trades! The idea is that eventually every involved hedge fund will be forced to purchase the stocks at a price heavily dictated by WSB.</text>

    <text>A short ladder is the process of two colluding parties conspiring to sell securities to each other at values lower than the current price, bidding lower and lower to create FUD in low-volume markets. It generally can’t be done in high-volume markets because arbitrageurs and people who want to go long bid the prices back up to a natural price. In this situation, no one thinks the price is justified, but the mechanics of the market in a short squeeze means prices are kept artificially high.</text>

    <text>It is illegal to coordinate to manipulate the market. But there's nothing wrong with this situation in general from WSB perspective. It's totally legal to just be like: "Hey, look over here at these idiots shorting 140% of float. This looks ripe for a squeeze. It might worth looking into buying some of this in case a squeeze happens".</text>

    <text>No, there are additional fees in trading and interest in shorting that would make you guaranteed to lose money either way if you did this.

I keep hearing this and it drives me crazy. 

The hedge funds are losing other people's money, that they bet with. Gabe Whatshisnamekin is not going to lose his mansion, be sure of that.

Are you asking yourselves who are those people losing money now, how many of them are extremely rich and powerful? How many of them are politically connected and have the capacity to change laws in their favor?  

All the respect to you guys, but your view is a bit too focused on the iceberg's tip and have no idea what big scary bears are being poked right now... Melvin, Citadel, Robinhood, all these are peanuts compared with the pissed off big boys controlling the game.</text>

    <text>Companies can issue new stock, which GameStop could do, to cash in on the high price. Normally companies can only do this up to pre-agreed levels at the annual shareholder meeting.

If banks who GameStop owes money to have Convertible loans, they can swap the loans for shares at a pre-agreed price. Then sell those shares on the open market, and make a killing. The bank makes a huge profit, and GameStop is no longer if debt, so it's win/win. This has happened with AMC who also had their share price pumped.</text>

    <text>Not really directly. The current squeeze can only happen  because there's a shortage of shares on the market, gamestop selling shares would probably sending it tumbling, assuming they can even sell shares fast enough before this naturally pops. 

They don't lose anything from this though and considering the entire world is talking about them, they probably have a lot to gain from the exposure.</text>

    <text>Money hasn't been pumped into Gamestop, just the price of shares (and thus the cost of buying all the shares which is called market cap, what people mean when they say a company is valued at XXX).

In theory gamestop could create more shares and sell them at these ridiculous prices. I don't know the legality of that but I imagine gamestop would want to just stay away from that minefield.

It also negatively affects anyone looking to buy a controlling number of shares of gamestop. Notably, the founder of chewy.com has been trying to buy up a majority of gamestop's shares when they were in the $10 and below range. He very likely is not currently continuing his plans lol. At least until the price finally crashes back to reality.</text>

    <text>“Hedging” is a general concept where you want to avoid a small percent chance of a very bad outcome.  You use it to go from a chance at a very good outcome to a high probability of a pretty good outcome—like insurance.

So back in August you bet on the chiefs to win the super bowl, and you had 10:1 odds (or whatever).   So you bet $100 and if they won the SB you’d get $1000.  

Flash forward to today: Now the chiefs are 50/50 to win (or whatever).  You’d prefer to have $500 for sure than possibly end up with $0. So what do you do?  You hedge.

How do you hedge? You bet $500 on the Bucs to win. So either they win and you get $500, or the chiefs win and you get $500 ($1000 minus the $500 you lost betting on the Bucs this week).  

You can short stocks to hedge but usually what you do is buy/sell options.</text>

    <text>They are saying they will got belly up since they don't have the cash to sustain the buying trade to carry out the transactions.

Real reason: to help create short ladder for the hedge fund clients (eg robinhood has Citadel which is 40% revenue source and has heavily shorted GME and is loosing billions there) -- which causes panic selling and then hedge funds can cover up their losses and then trading agency get their money (since retail investors don't give commissions to RH and most other trading agencies). People are just the product like for FB and google.</text>

    <text>Hopefully my reply will stay, also happy cake day!

GameStop would only benefit from this if they decide to sell the shares that they own. This would mean the company itself would be selling shares owned by GameStop. All the shares being traded currently are just public shares belonging to everyone, but GameStop. So these are just shares bouncing between investors that are rising due to the supply and demand. Normally the share price would be rising like this if GameStop did something spectacular to improve their business, but this time it is simply a matter of supply and demand.

 If they were to decide they wanted to raise money to help their business they could sell shares, but this would most likely trigger an investigation from the SEC for manipulation.  

Hopefully that helps!</text>

    <text>This is actually a more complicated question than you probably intended but an interesting one. If you are long a stock then you make money when it goes up and lose money when it goes down. You would have a delta of 1 as it’s called in trading, that is for every $1 change in the underlying price of the stock, you make $1. Now if you are short a stock, you would have a delta of -1. If you do both at the same time you would have a delta of 0, so you wouldn’t make any money on price changes because one position would gain and the other would lose.

Two things to add to this...there are delta neutral strategies but those are generally trying to capitalize on things like volatility. Long strangles and long straddles are options strategies that capitalize on price movement in either direction, similar to what you described. 

Shorting a stock you already own is called ‘shorting against the box’ and  was previously used as a way to defer paying capital gains tax. It’s since become a no no.</text>

    <text>Put and Calls are both financial instruments that are classified as options. Options fall under a broader class called derivatives, name as such because they derive their value from the underlying asset’s value. For example, the value of GME is derived from the actual stock price of GME. 

As the name implies, options give an investor the option to buy or sell a stock at a particular price. Put options allow an investor to SELL a stock at a pre-agreed price at a pre-agreed date. Now, in order to have that option, you have to pay what’s called a premium. So at the time you buy the put option, you have to pay the seller a value that is determined by the market (I won’t get into option pricing models here because it’s not that important).

Let’s say that GME is trading at $100 and you buy a put option at $80 for end of February.  In order to have that right, you pay $5 up front. If the stock falls to $60 on that date, then you are able to buy GME for $60 in the market and exercise your rights under the option to sell it for $80. You make $20 on the option, but remember, you paid $5 for that right so your total profit is $15. 

As you can see, put options that you buy are useful to protect against market losses. A lot of times they are equated to portfolio insurance, as with insurance you pay a premium to the insurer and if an event occurs (house fire, for example) then you get paid out for whatever was protected.

On the flip side is call options. A call option gives an investor the right to BUY a stock at a pre-agreed price and date. Again, for this right, you have to pay a price (premium). So back to our example, if GME is at $100 and you think it will go up you can buy a call option for end of February at $120 for $. If the stock end at $150 then you exercise your right to buy at $120 and can sell at the market rate $150. You make $30, but again you paid $5 for the option so your profit is $25. 

Call options are a useful tool for taking long bets into the market.

It’s also useful to mention that most options are “cash settled” so you don’t actually have to buy/sell the stock to get paid the value. Instead, the closing prices dictates how much the option is worth and you get that in cash. 

Now, to every buy transaction, there has to be a seller.  And so while buying a call and buying a put at most may cost you the premium paid, the person on the other side of the transaction has considerably more risk. For example, if you buy a put option at $80 and the price goes to $0 then your gains are $80 and someone has to pay that to you. What if that person doesn’t have $80? Well, you’d never get your money. So in order to prevent this, the options market has what’s called margin requirements. And these margin requirements dictate that the seller of options need to put up enough cash to settle the positions that they have agreed to sell as if the buyer sold their positions today. This process of called “marking to market”. So the option is valued daily and then the broker will tell the seller how much margin needs to be posted in order to maintain their position. With Puts, the maximum loss to the seller is the agreed price of the stock that the buy agrees to sell at ($80). However, for calls it is nearly limitless. So if a seller agrees to sell a call for $120 and the prices goes to $400 then they need to find $280 to pay out. If that all happens in a day then that becomes a major cash crunch for them and they may default. In that case, the clearinghouse who facilitates the settlements and margin process may be at risk of defaulting on the agreed trade which is a worst case scenario. But I’m getting into the weeds a little here and so will stop. 

To your second question, stock is a generic term for an equity (GME is a stock). You own a share of that stock. So you may own 10 shares of a stock. Sometimes shares and stocks are used interchangeably so I can see where there would be confusion.</text>

    <text>Yes they do! It’s a multi tiered approach to minimizing risk but that doesn’t exactly correlate to maximizing profits. These strategies have some pretty crazy names too like the “iron condor” which is badass.

To keep it simple I’ll describe it as betting that the stock goes up and down. You win either way but you also lose. This does not help your bottom line. It’s takes more finesse to balance your bets and increase/decrease them to maximize profits.</text>

    <text>A stock is what you invest in. Microsoft, Google, Amazon etc. You buy shares within a stock. Ex: im going to buy 50 shares of McDonald's tomorrow.

Puts and calls are under the category of options

Calls are contracts that give the right, but not the obligation to buy 100 shares of a stock at a strike price by an expiration date. Obviously you want this strike price to be lower than the real price by the time expiration hits. As you own a call, it will fluctuate in value in your portfolio based on the underlying stock and you can sell it back someone else, which is what most people do.2 things can happen when expiration hits, you're in the money (strike price is below the real price) and you get 100 shares essentially at a discount, or you're out of the money (strike price is higher than real price) and the contract expires, you lose all of the investment.

Puts are the same thing but reverse. You want the stock to go down and you sell 100 shares at a strike price.

I know this is a lot and believe me when I say I could go deeper and talk about the Greeks and time depreciation, but that is the bare minimum explanation. It took me forever to finally understand options, but they have been rewarding as long as you have backup plans and go cautiously.</text>

    <text>Puts and calls are both kinds of option. 

An option is a contract for the opportunity to buy or sell a stock at a set price up until a fixed date. You can either buy an option (you pay someone for the option to buy/sell) or you write an option. 

You buy a call option when you expect the price to increase. 

Writing and buying puts and calls can create more complex bets. 

Margin is using borrowed money to buy stocks or financial instruments. You need to keep some cash on hand though. You cannot buy 100 percent on margin. 

Stock and shares are normally used interchangeably. They refer to a small share of ownership of a company or sometimes multiple companies.</text>

    <text>People who decide to hold GME will always be holding GME. Whether hedge funds can afford their short positions or not. If you don't sell your stock you still have it. 

A more difficult question to answer is what will happen to the price of GME if the hedge fund can't afford to pay. At that point the only people involved will be firms that don't want to pay hundreds per share, and so they won't buy until the price crashes. And retail investors, who may or may not be okay continuing to trade to each other at extremely inflated prices. It will depend a lot on the sentiment of retail investors, but my guess is it crashes back down to pre-November prices.</text>

    <text>Well you wouldn’t actually “short” a stock you own, since shorting is the act of selling something you don’t own. What they would do in a “bearish” bet if they believed a stock would go down is purchase a put option. All that will effectively do is mitigate losses if the stock goes down. This is the typical way to hedge investments. Over the long run (say years) of doing this, all it really does is smooth out the investment return, because sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn’t, and timing it right is very difficult.

Now if someone intended to make money based on the stock moving significantly in either direction is that they would buy a call and a put option at the same strike, also called a “strattle.” That would achieve the intended effect but requires that the stock move well beyond its normal price range. It’s a risky strategy just like most anything that’s being discussed in this thread.</text>

    <text>Options are contracts to buy or sell stock at specific prices over the length of the contract.  There are 2 types of options; calls and puts.

Calls are contracts that give you the right to purchase shares from the counterparty at a specific price any time during the length of the contract.

Puts are the opposite.  When you buy a put, you have the right to sell your shares to the counterparty any time during the term  of the option.

Note that for every option, there are 2 sides, so if you BUY a call, you have have the right to trigger the contract.  But if you SELL a call, the counterparty is the one who can exercise the option.  Same thing with a put.  Whoever is long (buys) the option has the right to decide whether or not to exercise it.

Margin is basically borrowing money against your assets to purchase more of a stock.  Essentially leveraging.</text>

    <text>No. If you want to hedge on a stock you own (e.g. you want to keep it for dividends or tax purposes) you would probably buy a put or sell a call (covered call). Covered calls do have dividend risk though.</text>

    <text>Shorts borrow the stock to sell now and agree to buy later. The trade has negative gamma, meaning that when the stock increases you, the short position size is larger. so it can get out of hand fast and be very risky if not actively monitoring your positions. if you short it for a -4% position size at $20, if the stocks goest to 80 its -20% size. That's a 16% loss. GME went to over $300. You borrow the stock, so you post collateral (either long positions or cash) for the lender. When the stock increases you have to either post more collateral or be forced to buy back your shares at higher priced. This forced buying from margin calls and risk management purposes pushes the stock up even more beyond its fundamental value. In GME's case more than 100% of the share outstanding were shorted. Meaning shares were borrowed, then sold, then borrow, then sold again. it's kinda like fractional reserve banking. GME is a retailer which has been a short favorite of hedge funds for 5 years. The sharp rally in price, which caused by much of WSB buying short dated out of the money call options and buying from the market makers delta hedging, then caused a short squeeze on hedge funds.</text>

    <text>Puts and Calls are Options contracts. So Options refer to Puts and Calls as a whole. Puts lock in a price that you can sell a stock at in the future. Calls lock in a price that you can buy a stock at in the future. 

When you buy options, you buy the right to buy or sell a stock. You don’t actually buy the stock itself. 

Margin refers to a trading account where you also opened a credit line with the broker. Margin allows you to borrow a certain percentage of cash or value against your total account value. When the broker feels you have borrowed too much relative to your account value- this will happen if your investment positions go down- they will issue a margin call. You need to infuse your account with more cash or the broker will liquidate your account to protect their funds that they lent you. In this case you can have a negative account balance, if the stock moved against you so fast that the broker liquidated you at a loss. And this negative balance will become a liability to you- a debt burden. 

Stock is the asset (Microsoft stock). Shares are units of account for the stock (100 shares of Microsoft stock).</text>

    <text>Yes and no, I’ll explain. While r/wsb has the capability to move small market cap stocks, it’s not sustainable and we often don’t see these kinds of returns. It’s also illegal to pump stocks like that. A year or two ago, a user used wsb to pump a company called Lumber Liquidators. It was semi successful and the user got banned. So wsb can definitely move small market cap stocks temporarily. But really, we just really like the stock. 

What happened with GME is unique and truth be told, while AMC, NOK, BBBY, and some other stocks are being thrown around, they’re not entirely the same situation either.  So let’s look at the full thing here piece by piece.

1.	High Short Interest
GME was unique in that at its highest, there was 144% short interest. Short selling, btw, is when an investor borrows shares and sells them someone else hoping that the price goes down. So when it comes time to return the shares, the original investor buys them back less for what they sold them for. Short selling also applies a downward pressure on the price of the company. So Melvin Capital made a bet that GME would go bankrupt and they could buy back the shares for $0. Their massive short selling makes life very difficult for Gamestop as it drives their share price down which would make it difficult for them to find financing to fund any turn around projects. 
So naturally, they saw it as risk free to short 144% of outstanding shares. What they didn’t account for was that people would see value in GME and start buying up the float. Of the 69.75m outstanding shares that exist, Ryan Cohen bought up ~13%. Michael Burry also bought up a signifcant amount, institutions held a significant holding as well, and finally retail, us. This meant that the true availability of shares was heavily understated. There was limited supply. 
As supply goes down, the cost of borrowing goes uo for short sellers. The Borrow rate is often overlooked and its quite important when identifying squeezable stocks. This pressures Melvin into closing their short positions, but if theres also low supply of stock, the price goes up. So they pay a higher price to avoid ridiculous interest rates, but this causes their next ramp of shorts to become untenable and so on. Thats an infinite short squeeze.

2.	Gamma Squeeze.
Another unique situation with GME was as we started to buy to available shares and drive the price up. ALL Call options went ITM. This causes Melvin to get margin called and they have to buy shares to cover their calls. But no one wants to sell, so they massively overpay for the stock, driving the price up. This is a feedback loop at this point and then just causes all ramps of Calls to go ITM. 
The CBOE issues more call strike prices and Melvin and their butt buddies sell them to hedge their original short. Bad idea since these all also went ITM and they were forced to buy MILLIONS of shares. 
Earlier we established that even though outstanding shares totalled 69.75m shares, the true number of available shares is much lower. This is where we heard that short interest was as much as 400% of the float. Of actual available shares, they borrowed 4:1. 

3.	Diamond Hands
We diamond handed the crap out of GME and this makes Melvin REALLY over pay for GME. But they also have to close their positions as they were losing capital on a ridiculous basis. Three weeks into January and they were down 30% YTD. 
With wsb diamond handing their shares, it inflates the price to ridiculous levels. This is where we IBKR chairman stepping in saying they had to protect themselves and stop trading on GME. On one hand, Melvin would die if they continued to pay the interest, but on the otherhand, there are industry wide effects if we name our price. We are talking about potential losses approaching the TRILLIONS for Wall Street. And this is all because they decided to try to put a struggling retailer out of business and short 144% of the stock when anyone can see that its an inherently stupid move to do that. If supply is significantly less than demand, the price is just going to skyrocket.

Edit: I want to also mention that Ryan Cohen filing the 13D with the SEC was likely the catalyst for this explosion. When he did that, short sellers started to realize that they might not be able to cover their shorts with available shares. And coincidentally, we realized that too lmao
So NOK, AMC, etc, they need a whale on their side</text>

    <text>Technically, yes. But why pay the interest fee for short selling when you can just sell existing inventory without the extra cost?

Another alternative is to do a cover call. You sell a call option which would allow someone else to buy your inventory at a fixed price. If the market price doesn’t rise beyond the specified price, you pocket the money and toss the call option when it expires.</text>

    <text>Sequentially.  

A owns a stock, lends it to B, who sells it to C, who lends it to B, who sells it to A... 

Now B has shorted the same shares twice.  B has to buy the stock from A to return to C, then buy it back from C, then return it to A.

If the price has gone down, B profits twice.  If the price has gone up, B loses twice.  And if the price goes from $5 to $470, B loses *A LOT*.</text>

    <text>Hi - I have a master's degree in finance and figured I'd help explain.

Options are fairly complicated to explain so I'll try keep it simple

A put option and a call option are two types of options. An option is something that you can purchase that give you the right to make a decision in the future. 'Options' get their value from the underlying asset (e.g. stock). Because their value is derived from something else, they are a type of and known as a derivative security. 

When you purchase a call option (for a small fee), you purchase the right (not obligation) to buy something (e.g. a stock) in the future for a price agreed to today. 

When you purchase a put option you purchase the right to sell something in the future at a price agreed to today.

Because the fee to purchase options is relatively low, you can use options to gain exposure to a large number of shares without having the money to buy or sell the shares using more conventional means. Options are used for both speculative and risk management purposes. 

The terms stock and share can be used interchangeably. US prefers the term stock, while other nations use share.

Lastly, the term margin is generally referring to the portion of something that is financed (purchased) using borrowed money (loan) compared to the portion financed using your own money (equity). If I had to guess, you might be more correctly asking about a margin loan. A 'Margin Loan' is a type of loan commonly used to purchase stocks. These loans have certain conditions that require the borrower to pay the lender when the ratio between the loan (i.e. what you borrowed to pay for the stocks) and equity (i.e. what you put in) rises above a certain range - this is know as a margin call, which requires you to pay money to maintain the maximum debt/equity ratio agreed as part of the loan (occurs if the share price drops below a certain level, therefore raising the debt to equity ratio). This ratio changes with changes in the market value of the stock.The reason for this is that any fluctuation in stock price only impacts on the amount of equity - you are responsible for all losses and gains, your liability to repay the loan remains unchanged. These are high risk loans that magnify both losses and returns depending on the movement in stock price.</text>

    <text>This only really worked because GameStop was shorted so much and the float (number of shares) isn’t that big. It’s much harder to do on bigger, more liquid companies because you’re not likely to see shorts this big, and it’s hard to accumulate enough shares to put a short seller in a real squeeze.</text>

    <text>Options are one of several investment tools called "Derivatives" . Puts and calls are option contracts.

&amp;#x200B;

Puts: as a buyer of a put option contract, you believe the stock is going down.

Calls: as a buyer of a call option contract, you believe the stock is going up.

Margin is just a loan your broker extends you to leverage your account. E.G I have an account size of 50K. My broker will extend 50K worth of margin so I can trade with a total of 100K. Since the margin is a loan, I have to pay interest on it.

&amp;#x200B;

    <text>A Put Option is the first type of Option. Let's say I own a wheelbarrow, and you and I work out an agreement where you say you will buy that wheelbarrow from me for exactly $20, anytime I want, within the next two weeks. I don't HAVE to sell it to you, but if I WANT to, you have promised to buy it for exactly $20. Next week, wheelbarrows might be worth $30, in which case it would be stupid for me to sell it to you, so I won't. But they MIGHT be worth $10, in which case it would be smart for me to sell it to you for $20. Heck, I could even go buy two wheelbarrows for the money you just gave me!

Why would you do that? Because I'll give you a couple of bucks for the option to sell it to you. You'd be bettering that the price is going to go up, and I'd be betting that it's going to go down.</text>

    <text>This movement is significant *BECAUSE* gamestop was shorted so heavily. Keep in mind, in some cases it's been reported that they were being shorted 160%, which is not only logically nonsensical, it's illegal and something that hedge fund managers are all too comfortable doing. I'm sure you've seen the heath Leger joke "its about sending a message" meme floating around? That's basically the sentiment.</text>

    <text>The short answer to 1 is they are "derivative" securities that are valued based on a number of factors.  You are basically buying or selling a contract that expires and you are trying to not just bet on direction (long or short shares), but also time and volatility. All these factors go into the pricing of the option. They allow for greater leverage in a position with smaller capitol making up for the higher risk. YT "projectoption" for a good channel that teaches you the basics.  


EDIT: Margin is a loan from the broker so you can have more capital, but using too much can be very risky.</text>

    <text>1. Yes. You can only contribute $6k per year to an IRA. However you can set up an individual brokerage account and can put in whatever amount you want

2. Probably, robinhood for instance doesn't want people with below 25k account value day-trading (buying and selling shares/options on the same trading day). Idk how fidelity does it, you'd have to ask them. But if they're OK with it you can buy and sell however much you want</text>

    <text>2: You know how a group of cows is called livestock? Imagine a company's entire property is a group of cows. The stock is all of that company's cows. If you own one of that company's cows, you own one share of that company's stock. The company manages the cow, but it's yours.  


ELI6: Now that you're older, I can explain that when you buy a share, you don't actually get the cow. You get a certificate that says you own a percentage of the total cows.  


ELI7: Wow, having to get a certificate in the mail and figure out who to buy the certificate from and and keep track of it is a pain, so people use brokerages which are companies who keep track of the certificates for you. So the brokerage takes your money and buys the certificate for you and let's you know: okay, we got it, and technically, its yours. Let us know when you want to sell it.</text>

    <text>1.  You can have multiple types of accounts with Fidelity. You are restricted in the amount you can put into a Roth, but, you are not restricted with a brokerage (taxable) account. Yes, you can add more money anytime you want and buy within trading hours.
2. Yes, you can buy and sell the same stock as many times as you want at whatever frequency you want. Some brokers will charge you per trade or give you a certain number of free trades and some have unlimited free trades. Check with your account to see if you will be charged before engaging in high frequency trading. Another thing to understand is taxes. If you buy and sell a stock within one year, it is subject to short term capital gains tax and will be the same as regular income. You just add the profit of the sale to your taxes and you pay it like you do when you get a check from work. If you buy it and hold it for longer than a year, you pay long term capital gains tax, which is either 0 percent, 15 percent or 20 percent, depending on how much overall income you have.</text>

    <text>They could have pushed the price up on any stock. But then the people that bought in at the end lose a bunch of money when others sell out at the price goes down again.

This works because the stock was so shorted and these companies -must- buy the stocks at whatever price to satisfy their short. Its like the difference between owning all the tulips when people don't really need tulips vs owning -all- the tulips when a very rich man needs to eat tulips to live. You own him.</text>

    <text>**Is it more a case of the hedge funds involved can easily cover it but they don't have the cash meaning to cover the buys they have to sell a shitload of other stock to be able to cover it. It's just, if people aren't selling then how do the hedge fund buy the stock at higher prices?** \-- This is what drives the price higher. When you go buy stock it's not like at the grocery store where you find goods for x price. It's actually a bidding market. People put in the price that they're willing to buy or sell and then get matched up. When shares get scarce what will happen is that the people buying will increase their price to try to entice someone to sell. That's why the price of a stock will rise.</text>

    <text>Drive up the price? Sure. If you like lighting money on fire. 

There is no motive to, it would near certainly lose most on WSB money. But they could do it. 

There is no personal incentive to do so, it would simply be a loss of money.

The short position make sure that there is buyers when the price is high.</text>

    <text>As a long time member of WSB.. I assure you this is the first time this has ever happened. WSB is built around buying super high risk options in a few hot companies. Most people were losing money. This was a completely new tactic, buying shares to force a short squeeze in a low market cap company. We were a joke until GME. It will probably never happen again. The hedge funds weren’t looking before, but they are now.</text>

    <text>No, this happened because of how hard it was shorted. When you short a stock your borrow it, sell it, wait for the stock price to go down, and then buy a new stock when it’s time to return it. If the stock price goes down you can keep the difference and make money. The key here is that after selling it and waiting, you have to buy it again to return the stock. So now that the stock price has been going up, people who shorted it have to buy stock, raising the price even more. The key is that they have to buy it, and that is what people are waiting for. The hedge funds who shorted appear to be trying to manipulate the market to drop the stock price so they can buy it cheaper and reduce their loss</text>

    <text>First off: A short is when you borrow shares from someone else, sells them and then buy them back at a lower price. Thus making a profit.

Naked short is the same thing, except this time you don't borrow shares from anyone first. So you sell stocks that you don't have, and then you buy and deliver them to the buyer when the price is lower. This practice is illegal.</text>

    <text>You look up “short float &lt;insert stock name&gt;“ it will be a percentage of shares that are shorted. 

GME or GameStop has risen in popularity because some folks on /r/WallStreetBets figured out that Hedge Funds had borrowed more shares than actually exist. Meaning, for the shares that do exist, they will theoretically rise and rise and rise in value until something or someone runs out of money. What happens next no one knows.</text>

    <text>Naked short: You sell shares that you don't have, you will actually deliver them later (after you buy them). Illegal in USA.

Covered short: You sell shares that someone else lent you, you will reimburse the lender later in shares (after you buy them) .

&amp;#x200B;

There isn't much difference until the seller bankrupt. In 1st case the buyer is screwed he bought shares but will not get them, in 2nd case the lender is screwed he lent shares and will not get them back.</text>

    <text>Its more or less just made up by the company in question. I don't think there's any rules? Its usually in the millions. 15 20 million range for newer companies.

Sometimes a company will split shares too. Like maybe our company stock is going nuts and instead of 8 bucks q share its 8 hundred per share.  Well that can get kinda ridiculous and unwieldy to say, so we split the stock: now every single stock is actually 10 stocks. Instrad of 1 shqre at 800 . i have now 10 at 80 a piece.  That doesn't effect the bottom line user like us at all and makes it easier to handle. The stock price will drop technically but in reality its the same thing. I own the same amount of the company at the same price.</text>

    <text>Excellent description.

&gt; They figure that maybe if enough people can be convinced to buy GME stock, first the price will naturally rise if enough people want to buy

I have to disagree with this. Once GME became profitable the stock price rising naturally triggered a short squeeze. Definitely, WSB contributed to the short squeeze but they were piggybacking on a ticking time bomb that had already been armed. Really it was the hedge funds who got greedy and didn't calculate that out of 6000 stores some would be profitable. You can draw comparisons between GME and Blockbuster but GME demonstrated in august it wasn't in danger of bankruptcy. As soon as that happened, the stock became massively undervalued.</text>

    <text>Short selling is betting on a stock going down and you keep the dividends. It is buying a stock but in reverse. If you you sure to stock at $100 and it drops to $30 then you get $70. Basically hedge funds got f***** over because they shorted more stock than what was available and the prices climbed. If you bought it a hundred and it goes to 130 then you owe them $30, that is how shorts work.</text>

    <text>Think of margin as a account where they put enough money to buy back the shares. They do this to prove to the lender that they can afford to buy it back and repay their loan. When price adds the cost of buying all shares back increases and they have to put more money into that account to prove that they still can do it. If they can’t find anymore money the lenders will take the money and forcefully buy back the stocks at the current price to guarantee that it doesn’t keep increasing and they can’t get their stocks back.</text>

    <text>Go to bank, take a loan for 1000$, sell it for 800€. Wait for that 800€ to be worth 1100$ and pay interest to the bank while you're waiting. That's how. It only works with fungible assets, so money, stocks, certain commodities, crypto. Not financial advice, obviously.</text>

    <text>If you think the price of Xbox machines is going to fall, you can borrow your friends Xbox, sell it and then a while later you buy a replacement XBox at a lower price and you give that one back to your friend.   A short on the stock market is the same thing.  There is no set date at which you need to return the share.  You can basically wait a year or two before fixing everything up.  The general problem with the stock market is that everything tends to go up rather than down.   It’s easier to go down a river than up a river so it’s easier to buy lots of shares of different companies in the stock market and see most go up than to know exactly which one is going to go the wrong direction.   

Another problem with this idea of short selling is that it can lead to unlimited losses.  With normal investments, you buy a hundred Xbox machines and hope they go up in value and sell them at a later date at an increased price.  This is the famous “buy low sell high”.  The worst case scenario is that all lose all their value.  If each machine was $100.  If they all become obsolete, you would lose $10000 at most.  

With shorting, you can borrow 100 XBox machines and then a pandemic comes along and everyone wants an Xbox and the price could  go up by any amount of money.  Let’s imaging machines start going for $1,000 and now the people you borrowed from want their Xbox’s back because they are going to sell them.  You don’t have any so need to buy them. You need to buy 100 machines at that price so would have to pay $100,000 to close out your position.</text>

    <text>There’s a slight difference between a put option and a short contract, but it’s huge!  With an option, you literally have the option of not exercising it, meaning you only lose the cost of the contract.  With a short contract, there’s an obligation.  An option gives you the “option” of buying or selling a stock, but contracts mean you must pay back the stock.</text>

    <text>What day? I think that’s still in question. People were saying Friday, but now others are saying it’ll take longer.

What are the signs? From my gleanings, the ideal is that the hedge funds are going to be forced to buy their stock back at any price, sending the price “to the moon”. Some say they’re not selling until the hedge funds go broke, but by the time the price rockets, it’s probably about time to sell if you don’t intend to lose all the money you put in. Once the battle’s over, people will have no reason to hold on, and afaik there will be a mass selling of stocks that brings the price back down to normal—basically the ‘bubble’ bursting.</text>

    <text>1. There were a few investors who were bullish on GameSpot turning around and becoming successful. These folks were happy to buy stock.

2. GME stocks were massively shorted beyond the available float! This means that there were firms buying borrowed GME shares and then lending them out again to be shorted.</text>

    <text>Because of two things 1) Coordination problem and 2) Market liquidity.

Market liquidity is kind of an ambigous term but it simply means that even large trades don't have much of an impact on the stock price. For example, consider Alphabet, their stock is actively traded and daily trade volume is probably in the billions and hence even large trades don't effect the price very much. At the other end of the extreme are so called 'penny stocks', i.e. stocks with a valuation of less than 1$ per stock and often very small companies with low trading volume. Here, even small trades can have big impact on prices.

The coordination problem simply means that you have to get thousands (or tens of thousands) of people to buy a stock. That is, obviously, quite difficult but it is not unheard of. For instance, pump&amp;dump schemes means buying penny stocks and spreading fake news about the company to convince some  fools to buy the stock (pump&amp;dump schemes are for obvious reasons illegal). For Alphabet you would have to convince tens of thousands of investors to invest quite a lot of money into Alphabet to make the needle move.

With gamestop everything came together nicely. A hedge fund shorted a stock massively and had to start to buy the shares to give them back to their owners and an internet forum which took a disliking to it.</text>

    <text>Because normal people don’t have enough money to do that, and convincing hundreds of thousands of people to invest their money that way (especially in a dying company) is very difficult to do.  Even if you invested 5 million, it’s not nearly as powerful as a hedge fund with 50 billion.  Hedge funds have been doing this as part of their business model for a long time, but they got greedy and bet way too much blatantly thinking nobody would notice.  Well...a bunch of people did notice, and they all bet the opposite of the hedge fund.  Enough people eventually got on board and beat them at their own game.  And now they’re mad because they were supposed to be the only ones that can manipulate the market.  So now they’re losing big in a game they made the rules to and are super butt hurt that regular people beat them at their own game.  Citadel, CNBC, Robinhood, and probably many more companies are about to get  sued into oblivion because they fairly blatantly broke countless finance laws to stop losing money.</text>

    <text>That makes a lot of sense, thanks! It all seems so crazy, the fact that there are buyers willingly paying a few hundred bucks for something that is realistically only worth $40 or so. Hopefully they can get their money back selling the shares to the investment firms that are shorting the stock, because I imagine once all this blows over, and supply and demand return to normal, it will surely plummet back down. The people paying $300 per share are gonna be devastated.</text>

    <text>To clarify - some part of the 140% short is people selling shares they got "on loan"

Most of it though is promises to sell shares at a certain price.  If the stock goes down, you get to keep your money you sold that promise for.  If the stock price goes up... You still have to buy high and sell low to keep your promise, same as if you borrowed a share.  But each one of these promises is for 100 shares that you don't have to have or find first.  So it's 100 times worse.  This is where the vast majority of that short % you are seeing comes from.

They could, but there would be no point in that since there's 0 money to be gained after the purchase. At that point, you might as well just own the stock.</text>

    <text>You've got that correct. These large hedge funs have programs/AI that scour the internet for news articles and anything that might move a stock. So as soon as say Beyond Meat announces that they're partnering with someone new, that would cause the stock to jump. Their AI can find the article, understands what it means and will immediately buy shares. You cannot be faster than the hedge funds.</text>

    <text>You can as long as the brokers allow it. Today most brokers prohibited buying stock (that's a blatant market manipulation and Robin Hood got a class action lawsuit for doing it).

Recommended? No in my opinion. Never ever buy the coke can at $100 believing you'll sell it at $1000. "Buy high, sell higher" leads to "buy high, sell low" 99% of te time.</text>

    <text>&gt; Shorting shares is the practice of borrowing shares, selling them, waiting for the price to go down, buying them back at a lower price when that happens and giving them back to the lender

Why would the lender accept to lend shares to get them back when they are worth less money, instead of selling them when they are worth more?


Edit: I think I understood why, the lender except to win more money by lending then loosing, because short selling is risky, but in this gamestop thing the lender got fucked. Correct me if I'm wrong.</text>

    <text>Not true, both are manipulation. By far the most common form of market manipulation in history and the oldest has been the pump and dump. When you buy a massive amount of a trash stock purely to drive up its value, that is market manipulation, and people have gotten in huge trouble for it in the past. That’s what I’m worried about with DFV. He seems to be the central figure which makes him a target.</text>

    <text>I’m new to this too and jumped on Robinhood because “RH gold” got me $5k instant transfer (position 51.25 GME), been waiting on my other $6k to clear. Because GME *was* up, RH said I had access to another $5k, but halted buying for everyone’s “protection.” 

My point is to steer anyone AWAY from Robinhood, because for the next big short squeeze, they likely will do the same shady thing. Sure, they have a slick platform, but when shit got real, they turned into “Sheriff of Nottingham”</text>

    <text>1.) Brokers can only lend assets for short selling from what they have available to lend. You have to agree at some point whether when you opened the trading account or when you made the trade that you're happy for the broker to lend out your shares to short sellers. It would depend on the broker for sure but I'd be surprised if there was no way to opt out.

2.) The total position never actually goes above 100%, you have to include the short sold positions as a negative. For example imagine investor A has 100 shares they're happy to lend so total position is 100. These then get loaned to investor B who immediately sells them to investor C. These shares can again be loaned to investor D who sells to investor E and so on. So if we look at the position now it appears as though we've got triple the position on the same shares i.e A, C and E all own the same shares, but you have to include the fact that B and D are short so this cancels out and the overall position is (A: 100 + C: 100 + E: 100 - B: 100 - D: 100 = 100)</text>

    <text>In order to for short-sellers to close their short positions, they will need money from somewhere, right? Do these firms have other long positions?

Is there a possibility that they will close out these long positions in order get money to cover their shorted stocks?

If this happens, would that not flood the market with their previous long positions and perhaps even crashing those stocks **and maybe even the market as a whole**?</text>

    <text>You can't be forced to sell your stocks.  

If the price goes up enough, theoretically someone will sell though.  That's the whole idea behind financial markets, that they will find a price at which trade is the item is lively at a fair price.  

It could only work on a stock where there are massive short positions. If there are no short positions, you can't put the squeeze on short sellers.</text>

    <text>Basically. Large funds use technology like AI to trade very quickly and in ways that normal people with discount brokerages cant. Most people who place market orders have their orders filled very quickly, but at market value. That is extremely important because the market moves all the time, especially when the big boys are playing. So if you place a market order at $10 it’s possible it could fill at $12. There are other order types that prevent this.</text>

    <text>When you go short, you are borrowing the shares from a broker to sell on the market, in hopes of buying the shares back at a lower price and returning them to the broker, pocketing the difference.

If the shares go in the opposite direction, the broker fears you will not be able to cover your short (buy back the shares), so they do what is called a Margin Call. You  either have to provide more funds to your account to show that you can cover the rising costs or they will automatically buy back  your shares before things get to far away from you, thus limiting their risk.</text>

    <text>Yes, you are correct. Most institutional investors have direct access to brokers that can execute their trades as soon as they click their button. Some quantitative desks have the ability to buy/sell stocks in milliseconds through algorithms that feed directly to brokers. Most retail platforms have either a specific window in which trades are executed (i.e. M1) or they fulfill them as soon as possible (i.e. Robinhood). My understanding, and I may be wrong, is that Robinhood’s algorithm tries to aggregate trades as efficiently as possible in order to maintain their no-fee trading. As a result, you are probably looking at a 1-5 second delay in your trade being executed. Part of that is driven by their fractional share offerings. While you can buy .1 shares of Amazon on the platform, in real life, a broker would never accept a partial share purchase. As a result, they have to aggregate all Amazon trades happening at that moment in order to buy a block of full shares. Until they have that block, they won’t fulfill the order. It’s typically not an issue with heavily traded stocks, as they have a good amount of volume, but smaller, lesser known names may take longer to execute if volume is low. However, at the end of the day, unless you are on some day trader platform with commissions per trade, it is unlikely you will get best execution. Most institutional managers have dedicated trading desks and algorithms to ensure best price and best timing and thats something that mom and pop investors will never be able to replicate.</text>

    <text>so the part i don't understand is the 120% (or 140%, depending where you look) of shares that were borrowed. If the company was worth $500million at the time, that would mean that at $10 a share, there were 50 million shares available at that time, if they borrowed 120%, that means they borrowed 60 million shares. so now that they will need to buy them back to return them, and there are only 50 million shares in existence, how is it possible for them to purchase 60 million shares?</text>

    <text>Sometimes there's a specific date of return. But usually when you borrow a stock, you have to pay interest on the value each day/week/month you hold it. 15% on a stock valued at $5 is a very different thing to pay each week than 15% on a stock valued at $300, especially when you hold millions. There's only so long any business can burn money like that.</text>

    <text>I still don't understand how 120% of the stock was shorted.  I wouldn't call myself a sophisticated investor, but I have both a managed 401k and my own Ameritrade account and my understanding of short-selling is that it's contracted and typically only done by institutional investors.  The contracting part is the important part.  I pay a fee to you in order to borrow your stocks that you have no intention of selling but I'm convinced are going to go down in price.  So I pay you $10k, sell your stocks and agree to return the stocks to you at a time specified in the contract.  Say, three months later.  If all goes well, the stock is worth less in three months than it is when I sell, and hopefully the difference is more than the $10k I gave you under the contract.

But how do we get to 120% of stock shorted?  I actually find it a bit mind-boggling that you would ever see 50% of a stock shorted because casual investors like myself aren't entering into those contracts.  But more importantly, how could you possibly have contracts to short sell more stocks than exist?  If I have 1000 shares in BP, I can't "loan" you 1200 shares to sell.

Is this a bit of a glitch in the system that needs to be fixed?  Is this like bundled derivatives where Wall Street banks are buying and selling things that are either worthless or don't even exist?</text>

Casinos don't lose money, and people know that, but they go anyway because even if everyone else loses, they may still win a jackpot. But if they were at a casino where the jackpot winners got nothing, no one would go to that casino! The appeal is the hope of hitting something big.

So if everyone decides "screw it" and stops doing stuff with stocks, that would be very bad, or at least very disruptive, to the American Economy. So they need to maintain faith in the people that this whole stock thing we've been focusing on for the last hundred years isn't a bad idea.</text>

    <text>There's actually a lot going on in "this event" and different reasons as to why AOC and Cruz care, but these are the simplest ones:

1) AOC is a democratic socialist. Yesterday a bunch of brokers stopped facilitating trades of GME and others, either outright or UNLESS you met a certain set of conditions, conditions that you and I literally can't possibly meet... but billionaires can. To her (and a lot of people) this is proving that the market is rigged against average joes and in favor of the rich.

2) for Cruz, he believes in a "free" market, in which you and I have the same access to trades as rich people, and brokers blatantly limiting those trades, specifically for companies trending in wsb, is not the "free" market he believes in.

What's happening now goes against both of their beliefs, but for different reasons. It's absolutely beautiful.</text>

    <text>I don’t really expect to understand the overall situation, but I’d like to understand the morality of the two sides. Were the hedge funds being immoral in their previous practices (before the whole fiasco started)? Was what WSB bets immoral? Was anything either side was doing illegal?

My main stake in this right now is that shutting down the ability for the “common people” to buy is immoral, but I’m confused about the morality of everything that led up to this.</text>

    <text>The situation, in a nutshell: a bunch of everyday-joes found a catchy way to outplay some super-wealthy bankers at their own game. Based on some dangerous investments, these billionaires stand to lose a lot of money if the stock price jumps instead of tanking as expected. So this is a consequential prank/protest.

As I understand, there are two important things going on here:

1. This is showing the kinds of manipulative tricks that rich people do all the time to game the system, and bringing that into the public conversation could lead to shifting public opinion and new regulations.

2. Poor people are claiming a kind of power through group effort. It hints at how poor people might upset the system in other ways, and the fallout may also illustrate how the powerful institutions circle the wagons to protect the wealthy.

In the age-old history of class warfare, this action is something quite new and very modern. So it's both interesting and consequential.</text>

    <text>Shorting is "borrowing" shares. Borrowing has an interest cost. So sure, they could wait, but it costs them interest in the meantime. Additionally, they must hold capital in collateral against these short positions, as their notional losses rise (if the price increases). The result of this will be that they have to unwind other, unrelated, positions, which will also ultimately cost them money/opportunity.</text>

    <text>I believe the main thing is that people are accusing Robinhood and investment firms of market manipulation, which is illegal

Big investment companies buy trading data from Robinhood. That's how it makes money. So the accusation is that they colluded to prevent people from buying more Gamestop shares and thus pull down the price, in order to limit losses for the investment firms.</text>

    <text>Yes.  When you IPO your company gets a valuation, and you issue stocks accordingly.  A stock is an investment; quite literally purchasing stock in a company. It’s a way to raise capital.  If I started a company and it was valued at $800M, I’m going to issue stock at a price point that would entice investors, but I’m also going to keep (and give stock options) to the people at the top.  So when I have 100,000 shares valued at $5 each, issue a bunch more, and people drive the price up to $50, I just turned $500k into $5M.  The main reason the biggest companies are the ones publicly traded is because the entire process is expensive af, and nobody is going to buy stock in a mom and pop restaurant with one location.  The cost to IPO is in the millions.  What small business has a million dollars laying around to give to financial analysts?</text>

    <text>&gt; while ordinary people have to go through brokers who might take hours/days to execute "the trade". Is this correct in any way?

Hours/days is too much, the true speed is at most a few seconds for the average person. In fact the latency for your internet is probably more than the latency of the average trade. If you get a good broker though, they will give you fast trades. 

The hedge funds do however pay for their millisecond trading rates. The hedge funds in fact will often buy property right next to the stock exchange so that they can get quotes and trade faster.</text>

    <text>Green energy companies don't exist. We can't grow our way out of our environmental and ecological collapse. You can't have infinite growth of any kind green or not on a finite ecological base. Essentially we are withdrawing more from the bank than we make every year, over and over. Green tech has a lower energy return on investment and adds more complexity to our energy system which makes it more fragile. So while it is much better in the short term for climate change it is not in any way a solution.</text>

    <text>Idk about that though. I know what you’re saying and I don’t know shit about stocks or trading or well most things. However what I’ve been seeing is people putting in a hundred or two that they are fully willing to lose just to fuck wallstreet. I think most of them realize they may get nothing out of it, but they want to see some change and voice their displeasure in a way that will make the rich actually listen and take notice and hitting them in the pockets is the only way to do that. Most are taking a ride to be a part of the movement and if some of them make money along the way more power to them.</text>

    <text>Paper trading is the best for this. You give yourself as little or as much money to start as you want. Then that "paper" increases/decrease as if it was actually cash in the real stock market. I used to use the E-Trade app, but Webull is also popular.</text>

    <text>One thing I'm wondering, if you want to sell a bunch of shares, does it all happen at once? 

Let's say I have 1000 shares that are currently worth $10 and I want to sell them all. Would I get $10 for each of them, or is there a chance that after selling the first 100 shares, that would drive the price down for the remaining 900 shares, and by the time they are all sold I made far less that $10 per share?</text>

    <text>Am very inexperienced with stocks but let me see if I got it right:  
WSB banded together, through whatever means to buy GME stocks (with knowledge that hedge funds were shorting GME).  
  
WSB's "bet" worked in their favor.  
  
Hedge Funds/Billionaires are furious because they are being beat by their own games(?)  
  
Did I do good?</text>

    <text>Your bottom paragraph was an accurate summation. If someone has been doing crappy things to others for years, it’d be hypocritical to cry when someone does something crappy back at them.

I think I get the gist of it now. Short-selling GameStop itself wasn’t necessarily bad, but these hedge funds were incredibly evil in the past, so what WSB did is basically a bit of karma against them. I can’t claim to know about the historic evil of hedge funds, although I think that’s something a little research could turn up easily, so I’m not going to bother you about that.

Thanks for taking the time to go through these things for me!</text>

    <text>Right, I just don’t even get how such a concept is even possible to legalize, no matter how much money you throw to the lawmakers. It feels like asking them to write a law that removes the effects of gravity from an object, causing, say, a bowling ball to float of its own accord. There’s probably something I’m just not getting here that *does* make it possible, it just seems so illogical.</text>

    <text>One of the online brokers has a virtual account they give you along with your real account. Iirc they give you $100k in virtual funds so you can see how your theories play out before you enter your real money into the real market. You can open an account and not link your bank/money to it. Sorry I don't remember what broker but you should be able to search it.</text>

    <text>So, to make sure I’m understanding your explanation: group 1, which is someone who owns lots of stocks, sells them all, which scares other people into selling them. This allows group 1 to buy back the same stocks at a lower price, thereby turning a profit on the whole thing. Then later on, once the stock has revalued a bit, group 1 sells a bunch of them again, repeating the process over and over until the stock is worthless. And this is all artificially devaluing the stocks, since instead of it being based on the actual performance of the company, it’s based on group 1 scaring the market into selling too much. Does all of that sound accurate enough?</text>

    <text>Mostly, brokerages are letting hedge funds borrow stock for shorting. Those stocks are owned by people and other institutions (hedge funds, companies, etc) and lent out by brokerages.

Hedge funds that shorted can't wait this out either, because contracts to borrow stock almost always require interest payments (tied to stock value) until they give the same # of shares back to the broker. Trying to wait it out could just as easily bankrupt them as trying to close their position right now. Some of them have partially closed their position, but there are still more shorts than actual shares, so the retail investors who are buying and holding expect the price to go up even further.

The contracts that are created for shorting also require repayment by particular dates. This is why people are focused on tomorrow, because that's when hedge funds will start being forced to return stock by the brokerages they borrowed from.</text>

    <text>Basically. I don’t understand a lot of it if I’m being honest, I’m very cynical about the whole thing. From what I understand I’m glad the smaller investors are sticking it to them - I think the entire idea of shorts are incredibly shitty and should be borderline illegal as it looks like they’re seriously messing with the market - again I have limited knowledge but that’s what I’m getting from it. 

I just wholeheartedly hope the mega rich hedge funds loose a substantial amount of money from this, as a deterrent if nothing else.</text>

    <text>Nothing changes for the company directly. Market value isn’t the same as the value of the share on the balance sheet which would be the price it was originally sold to investors at (and therefore funds received by the company for the issuance of stock). A company does not receive additional revenue when an already publicly traded share changes in value or is transferred between 2 3rd parties.

The CEO is probably hoping this drums up a bit of interest in the company and their turnaround plan from the press coverage received.</text>

But I keep seeing redditors telling us to buy gamestop stock and hold it. But if we can buy it can't they buy it? 

How long do they have to buy the stocks that they owe to others?

    <text>&gt; 120% of available shares

This is the part I keep hearing and don't understand. Because to me this should mean that they sold 20% more shares than what was possible to sell.</text>

    <text>It is unusual but definitely possible (and apparently at some point it was even 140% shorted).

Say only 100 GME stocks exist and you own them all.  I borrow 60 of them from you and sell them to Fred.  

Then Geoff comes along and he borrows 50 shares from Fred and sells them to Ted.

Kablam.  Total short position is 110 (60 from me and 50 from Geoff) with 100 shares in existence.</text>

    <text>Yes, you are correct. However when they sell and profit, due to the demand another person buys it,  increasing the cost more. The trick is to not sell out to soon so that you may maximize profit,  the problem is that if you miss the peak you'll make less money.</text>

    <text>That’s exactly how it works.

When you sell, you believe the price will drops 
When you buy you think the price will increase.

Nobody knows which one is correct, and one part will always lose.

There is no guaranteed “win” here. If there was, people would be piling onto it.</text>

    <text>Most people let others borrow stock from them. If you have a 401k and own some index funds in it, chances are the shorts are borrowing directly from you! 

Hedge funds can’t just wait it out for two reasons: first, because shorts typically expire. I borrow stock from you, I promise I’ll give it back to you in two weeks, and then I sell it. In two weeks I have to pay you back! Second reason is that since you can lose unlimited money when you short stock, most of the time you will be required to post some amount of collateral against your borrowing to cover the potential loss. This is a very simple example, but say I want to short a stock at $100. If the stock goes up to $200, I am losing $100. My brokerage will want to make sure that I actually have $100 to lose, and if I don’t they will close the position before it gets so large i can’t pay for it. For large institutional investors it’s not quite this linear, but similar principles apply.</text>

    <text>I guess it depends on your definition of what qualifies as "rich". But normal people can profit from this, yes. One way to profit is to simply wager the stock will continue rising in value and holding the stock until a later time. This is a long call.

Another position you can take is to simply buy the stock now, at a very high value, with the almost assured assumption that it will eventually fall back down to it's usual price. After all, GameStop \*IS\* going out of business. This isn't an attractive stock.

Your question on price is interesting: assuming everyone is buying/selling a stock for a "good reason" exactly what causes the price to move then? It ultimately depends on what is called the market spread. Most orders on the stock market are an exchange between a market order and a limit order, not two market orders. Two market orders is similar to the idea of you and I just meeting up now and trading assets. A limit order is more like posting a notice on a bulletin where I let everyone know "if the stock ever reaches a certain value, then I'll be ready to buy/sell". Simply put, depending on the amount of limit orders pushing the price higher/lower, and the volume of the trading in settling those orders, the price will follow with density.

Hope that helped.</text>

    <text>Anything stopping the deadline being extended for the hedge funds shorts being due? Like whoever they borrowed from just being like, yeah, we’ll give you an extra month or two until you gotta buy them back? I remember the saying “delay and pray” when it comes to companies that owe the principal on loans they can’t pay back, so the lender extends the due date, basically just kicking the can down the road. Seems like something they’d pull in this scenario. I’m sure all the small investors wouldn’t have the patience to hold out that long since most are in it to make a quick buck.</text>

I know it goes against the norms of trading but I don’t think you should be able to hope for failure.

For options, the assumed value stands. If I originally made a call for 100 shares totalling 100 out of 60000000 and now each share/slice is divided by two; then the call option will be for 200 out of 120000000</text>

    <text>Exactly. Not everyone is going to get rich after all of this blows up. Most people involved in the GME stock will, indeed, lose almost all of their investment. The thing is: most WSB people that bought GME stocks did it either "for the memes" or to mess with the rich and they know they'll lose. John Doe over there burned $1000 of their "hobby money" for the lulz, then called some hundred friends to do the same with their own "hobby money". 

As a collective, WSB is as fucked as the hedge funds they want to crash once the GME bubble bursts, but unlike those hedge funds, the money they're losing is THEIR OWN MONEY, they won't bankrupt themselves by losing it, and they don't care if they lose it anyways.</text>

    <text>When you short a stock you give the person you borrowed from money as collateral. Say I borrowed 5 shares at $5,000 total. As the stock price goes up and $5,000 is no longer enough to cover 5 shares you get what is called a margin call, which is basically the person saying I need my stock back because you no longer have enough money to pay me. So you either have to give me more money or you have to cover. In order to cover you have to buy the amount of stocks you bought and give them back. So the short squeeze occurs when a bunch of people who are short are forced to cover and buy stock which in turn drives the price of the stock up even higher. So they don't have the option on how long to hold because as the price goes up they will be forced to cover.</text>

    <text>In theory they could, but there’s two things at play here. One is that the losses are theoretically infinite. What this means is if the people who own the stock hold on to it without selling it, the price per share could rocket to unfathomable levels. At some point the hedge funds who borrowed the stock are going to run out of collateral that they put up to borrow the shares, and the banks that loaned them the shares are going to start demanding the shares back. In addition, they have to pay interest every day they don’t return the shares, and that is only going to increase and companies may not be able to wait that out.

The second thing that influences this is what’s known as the gamma squeeze. Essentially companies wrote what are known as call options to people wanting to buy an option to purchase 100 shares of the stock at an agreed upon price at an agreed upon date. 

Example:

Let’s say GameStop is trading at $10/share but you think it’s undervalued and the stock price will go up. In fact you are so confident in this that you want to be able to buy GameStop at its current price ($10) one month from now. You decide to come to me and say “hey I’ll give you $100 right now if you agree to sell me 100 shares of GameStop at $10 (this is the strike price) one month from now (this is the expiration).” I think to myself *there’s no way this stock will be more than $10 a month from now, that’s easy money* so I decide to agree to this.

Let’s say next week the price of GameStop doubles and it goes up to $20. Because the strike price is below the current market value, this is what’s known as in the money (ITM). Also since it hasn’t hit the expiration date yet, you are free to exercise your call option at any time. You then come back to me and say “okay I would like to buy 100 shares at our agreed upon $10 per share.” Since I don’t have those shares, I then go to the market and buy 100 of them at the current market value of $20 and sell them to you for $10 each. You can then go and immediately turn around and sell them back to the market for the current value of $20 per share. 

Your profit: (20 x 100) - (100 + 10 x 100) = $900

My loss (100 + 10 x 100) - (20 x 100) = -$900

So how is this relevant? Well there are a lot of call options that are going to expire tomorrow, and the overwhelming majority of which will be in the money. This means that the companies that wrote to sell the call options are going to be forced to buy shares of the stock to cover these options. This in turns drives up the price even further since there will be increased demand to buy the stock</text>

    <text>Not made up at all. You are buying part ownership of a company when you buy a share of it. You buying a share of their company gives the owners money to use to expand their business, and if the company does well then the stock does well. Since you are a part owner, you also benefit from this. It is very real, and has a ton of depth to it</text>

    <text>As I understand, short sellers have to pay a commission to the people they borrow shares from, and if the stock spikes up, they buy back the number of shares they shorted (basically shorting the stock).

Then how can someone borrow more than 100% of the shares (in case of GME and Melvin)? If GME really rockets, how could the shorts possibly re-buy? (Don't we have a broken market in our hands now?)</text>

    <text>Its pretty easy.

Say your buddy wants to open a store, but he needs money to do so. He asks you and another buddy for money to get started, in return he offers to say split the profits of the store and decision making process with you two (splitting ownership of the store equally between the three of you). 

You agree, and it happens. 

At this point, each of you own a "share" of this store business, you are entitled each to a third of the profits and a third of the decision making process. There are 3 total shares in this company at this point. 

Say you no friend that you invested in no longer want to be part of this business, but your friend Bob has shown interest in it. He makes an offer to Bob to buy his share of the company in the business, he accept that offer, congrats, the share in the company has been sold. 

Business is booming and you want to open up another store. The three of you get together and decide you are willing to give up another equally controlled portion of the company to sell to someone else to raise the funds needed to open another store. You find Charlie, who is willing to buy this share, there you go, you have just made an additional offering of this share. 

At this point, each of you own a 25% share in the company.


Charlie no longer wants his share in the company but business is booming. Charlie unfortunately has no friends so to find someone willing to buy his slice of your company, he goes to a place where he knows he can find someone to buy his slice of the company, he heard a bar in New York has a lot of people looking for things to invest in, and people with opportunities to invest. He goes there, chats up Alice, they strike a deal, and sells his share to Alice. 


You can kind of see how it progresses from here. At some point a lot more people start crowding this bar, someone decides to buy a place that is dedicated for exchanging shares in companies (known as an exchange). For the next century they yell over each other to buy shares in an auction style type of thing, or just privately talk to others and strike up deals in the exchange. 

Rich people give their money to brokers so that they can invest money for them, do all the shouting on the exchange floor. People figure out at some point that computers kinda make this whole buying and selling thing easier rather than yelling over each other, so they create computer programs that can send and receive orders to a main computer that pairs up orders that work with each other. Etc.</text>

    <text>One thing I'm not clear on is what happens if they owe more than they have. I get that they can be forced to liquidate but it's still a finite amount. If Melvin is holding the bag the market cap should theoretically be limited by their total assets. Presumably this screws all of their clients regardless of whether or not they were bought into GME.</text>

    <text>Not really. I'm not a trader by any means, but stocks are basically shares in a company.

If a company has 100 stocks, and you buy 1 stock, in effect you own 1% of the company. Companies issue (sell) stocks of themselves to generate money to use and invest in the company.

These stocks can then be traded between other people, just like any other commodity. Just like you can buy bread at walmart, who didnt produce it but just bought it from someone else.

Stock prices follow the same supply and demand rules as everything else. The more people want a product, the higher the price is, and the less people want it the lower the price is.

And just like in a normal market, this can change and be abused. A price is simply a set number we are willing to pay for a product. If everyone suddenly decided they wanted to buy bread, the price of bread would skyrocket as well. Maybe not immediately, but over time. Stocks just move a lot faster than products, since you buy and sell immediately.

    <text>They’re not actually pushing the stock price down, they’re just increasing volatility and encouraging people to sell.

Also, a raid by a mob of randos on Reddit isn’t really a risk in the market sense, it’s more of one in the operations planning sense.</text>

    <text>Is it at all possible for the owners of the lent shares to renegotiate the length of the share?

I don't really understand how shares work, honestly. How do companies decide how many shares to sell, is there a standard number? Are there hard copies somewhere or is it just a notion of owning 1/100000 of a company? 

When they are shorted, who is lending the shares? If I bought 50 shares of a company who has 10000 shares. If that company isn't doing well, can someone approach me and ask to borrow my shares until January 28, 2022? How am I compensated for the shares? 

I have so many questions. If anyone answers, thank you!</text>

    <text>When you buy a stock, you can just hold it and have no obligation to sell it.

When you short borrowed stock, you have an obligation to pay it back. A bank wouldn't let you "hold out" on paying your mortgage, they'll foreclose and liquidate the house.</text>

    <text>If you do not have an account elsewhere, it will take at the minimum a day to verify and provide funds. So if you only have RH, that will be the only place you can buy tomorrow. 

At open they are limiting people to 5 shares which may increase over the day.

I plan to get out of RH as soon as possible, I've already opened up a Webull and Ameritrade account waiting to be verfied. I believe Webull temporarily stopped trading of GME as well for part of the day.

There are no official reports of sale of stocks owned with cash being cancelled, only margin ones. However, these margin sales were forced because of market manipulation by them.</text>

    <text>If the hedge funds get away with this, then business as usual and the working class Americans suffer.

If they DO NOT get away with this, then we may possibly see the end of hedge funds as an industry! If anyone can rally and pump a stock that a hedge fund is betting against, no one will ever setup multi-billion hedge funds again. It simply becomes too risky. 

IMO that's a good thing. With more financial tools in the hands of the average citizen, it's only natural that these large corporations go away.</text>

    <text>Yes definitely.  All stock exchanges I ever worked with have temporary and/or day long automatic trading halts when prices fluctuate too much in a short time, i.e. when volatility goes through the roof.

They're meant to give everyone involved some time to think whilst the trading is halted.</text>

Do they have money to cover it or will they need to sell the rest of their portfolios driving other etfs' prices down? (And consequently, other people will sell the same etfs even if they don't need the money now, just to avoid ending up with low-valued etfs if I get it right...)</text>

    <text>Yeah, seems like the folks invested in the downward part are still having a shit time, it just incentivizes people to manipulate this so someone goes all the way down instead of rallying. And if EVERYONE is going through a downswing, it's just another way to benefit from already having the capital to buy up shit. I'd be interested if there's any really rigorous, objective research on this.</text>

    <text>There are some explanations of short selling here, but you can also buy put options in order to make money when a stock price decreases. 

Essentially, you buy the right to sell a certain number of shares of a stock to someone else by a certain date at a certain price. So if the stock price goes below the agreed price on your put option, then you can buy the stock for the new lower price and sell it to the person you bought the put option from for the higher agreed price. Or you could just sell the put option to someone else since it has increased value now that the stock price decreased.</text>

    <text>Relating to the GameStop scenario, a lot of people here have explained why these large corporations are losing a lot of money by shorting the GME stock and expecting the value to drop before they buy the shares back to return to the original owner. 

My question is: who are they borrowing from? Are they just stockholders who has shares of GME in the first place? What of they don't want to lend it, do they have an option of saying no? I'm confused what's in it for the people lending these mega corporations shares if they aren't the ones making money by loaning out their shares. 

I'm new to this so forgive me if I'm not asking the right thing here.</text>

    <text>The lender may not agree that the company is doing badly.  Some large institutional investors have by-laws preventing them from doing reshuffles of their holdings more frequently than x so they have to keep the shares anyway.  Some may be executives in the company who cannot legally sell those shares unless specific circumstances.  Lending the shares is a way to get some money from them when you want to or have to keep them.</text>

    <text>Each broker will have their own nuance as to when/why to stop trading. Most of the time though it'll be for financial reasons of the company. This is why I've been using the pink sheets so often in my examples.

Unlike the companies listed on the big exchanges (NASDAQ, NYSE) there is no financial requirement a company has to have to be traded on the pink sheets. These companies are the highest level of risk for investors. They have no proven financial record. This risk is a risk to the brokerage firm and it's customers. For example, there is no research the average investor can do to determine if it's a good stock or a bad stock. 

The broker may do the research on XYZ and decide that they are too financially unstable to an unlearned (read: retail) investor. So they won't allow their customers to trade that stock. They might not be doing anything illegal, but are just too high risk. On the generous side that's the brokerage firm, "looking out for it's clients!" On the business side, that means their customers won't lose money on an extremely risky bet and keep the money to invest so the brokerage firm retains more money. 

Now GME is the interesting case. It wasn't a "risky" stock. All indicators told the story that GME would continue to fall. Also, it was reasonable that retail investors would come to the same determination that the stock would be bearish. Then, all this happened. 

To play devil's advocate and take the broker side of the argument:
 You have an extremely volatile stock in GME. It could go to $1k, it could crash to $0. You have retail investors that sat down and watched a 5 minute clip on the news about this situation. John Doe thinks to himself, I'm going to buy this stock because of the hype around it. He has done no research for himself. So he goes out and trades his entire retirement account into GME at the day high of $400. He checks his balances at the end of the day and sees it close at $250! He just lost a ton of money! In fear he goes to his account the next day and sells all of his GME stock. Now he lost half of his retirement because of an investment he didn't understand. 

So in order to prevent this, the broker stopped trading on a volatile stock for retail investors to save the investors from themselves. In addition, there is no reason why the company Gamestop financially should be trading so high. They don't have the earnings, capital, or any other asset to support such a high stock price. So the the financial risk is there based on the company for the broker to stop trading the stock. 

Now, is that the reason these brokers stopped trading on the stock? Again, up to you to review the answers.</text>

    <text>So if you want to short a stock, you have to have a lender willing to let you “borrow” the shares in the first place, right?  If so, how come so many lenders were willing to let these hedge funds “short” GME?  The lenders are trying to make money too, right?  And the way they would make money is if the stock had gone up by the time their shares needed to be returned.  

So how could these lenders have confidence that GME wouldn’t keep falling...whereas up until a few days ago it seemed like it was inevitable.

That’d be like me owning stock in phonebooks (if there is such a thing) and someone wants to short my shares because he thinks they’re gonna keep falling.  If I lend him my phonebook shares aren’t I saying “I have confidence that I am going to make money because I believe that these phonebook shares will go up and the borrower will owe me money in the end.”</text>

    <text>Because this is slightly incorrect. Nobody knew about the short position originally. Our God at WSB u/deepFuckingvalue noticed a year ago how GameStop was going to be super undervalued. So this whole party started a while ago. It was until recently that this whole debacle ensued. It’s controversial because Melvin Fuckhead Capital says this was market manipulation essentially because Redditors are driving the price up just to screw them when actually it was them using shitty unsafe practices to try to make a buck and hurt a recovering company</text>

    <text>Okay, cannot get these basic q's resolved:

1. Back in the day I could have my stocks mailed to me in paper certificates and hold those physical shares for myself.  Is it possible to have stock transferred out of a brokerage and into my own hands?

2. Is there a broker or trust that my retail brokerage can transfer my holdings to, one that will just hold them and not loan them out or sell them or ultimately use them any way they can?

3. Edited/revised: Can retail brokers ultimately do what they want with my stock, merely because it is held by them, similar to how our money is when we put it into a bank.</text>

    <text>The company can always sell more shares so a higher value stock means they can raise money easier.

A lot of tech companies also pay employees with stock options meaning they set aside a number of shares at lower prices for an employee. Then after the employee has been with the company for a set period of time they can buy the cheap shares and can sell them at market price. It's like a bonus the company doesn't have to pay</text>

Of course it could have gone up in value (and that's the current crux of the situation now), and I'd have to kick in some of my own money to buy your house back.

But it was never MY house to sell in the first place..

Maybe I haven't had enough coffee, but that last part just doesn't sit right with me.

I know that banks take money you deposit and lend it to others for a fee (and you get a little bit of that fee (interest)), and that the movement of this money is seamless to us as we can go empty/close a bank account whenever. 

Is that similar to what the hedge fund managers are doing?</text>

    <text>Some people will lose, yes. The gains are usually better for people who have been in the longest (which is kind of reasonably their right). At the moment, the shorts need more stocks than are publicly traded (not in ownership hands) to recover their position, which means that the hedge funds will need to buy each privately held \*available\* share AT LEAST once to meet their obligations or they lose. The only way WSB loses is if enough people sell early during one of the artificial dips and those stocks cycle through AGAIN or if they wait out the entire bubble (which some people intend to do because they legitimately BELIEVE in the fundamentals of the company relative to whatever their buy in price was). At the moment, its really difficult to lose, and taking down the architects of the housing crisis is an appealing reason to get in on the action.

Every investor-held share of GME is a share that kills the hedge fund position and secures the profits of every other investor-held share.</text>

    <text>That's where the stock market is different from the real world.

In the real world you have one of two scenarios:

1) The person who borrows a thing to then sell it would be doing an illegal sell because he can't transfer ownership of a good that he himself just borrowed and has no ownership of. In this case it could be that the person buying it would need to give it back (because he never actually had the ownership and got tricked by the seller/borrower). In this case he could sue the person that sold it to them for damages of course, like getting tricked into buying a borrowed bicycle for example.


2) The person buying the good only buys the contract of the borrower, so he only buys the right to use it for the remaining time and then has the responsibility to give it back to the original owner.



But on the stock market you can legally sell a share that is actually not yours and the person buying it from you becomes the legal owner of that share. That's the huge difference between the both worlds.</text>

    <text>I have 10 shares of ABC.

You think ABC is going to crash. You come to me and ask to borrow my shares and pay me interest for borrowing them. I tell you sure.

You now have 10 shares of ABC and owe me 10 shares of ABC. You sell them at $100. 

You now have 0 shares of ABC and still owe me 10 shares. You have $1000 cash.

Two weeks later ABC has a bad earnings report and is now trading at 50 dollars. You buy 10 shares of ABC.
You now have 10 shares of ABC, owe me 10 shares and have $500 cash.

You now return my shares to me. I have my 10 shares + the interest you paid, you have $500 minus the interest you paid.

Now if instead of going from 100 to 50, the stock goes from 100 to 200, you still owe me my 10 shares. In this situation though you would lose $1000. If the stock went from 100 to 500 you would lose $4000</text>

    <text>The hedge fund (Citadel) is a major customer of Robinhood (something like 40% of their revenue) and buys info about trades done on Robinhood. Citadel gets info about trades just before Robinhood fulfills the trade, which lets them adjust their position in response. No one knows who owns Robinhood, but the two are closely connected at minimum.</text>

    <text>Ingen aning överhuvudtaget haha. Folk, särskilt folk på r/Wallstreetbets, verkar ju tro att "the short squeeze" inte har hänt än och att det först lär hända nån gång under nästa vecka.

Själv funderar jag på att köpa två eller tre aktier 15.30 när Amerikanska börsen öppnar. Ingen aning om det är en bra idé. Faran är ju om "hedgefunds" inte köper aktierna, men om teorin stämmer så låter det ju som att dom kommer vara så illa tvungen att börja köpa, förmodligen händer det ganska snart. Så fort att "hedgefunds" börjar köpa så gäller det att sälja ASAP.

Den andra faran som jag har förstått det är att folket på r/Wallstreetbets och andra som investerat helt enkelt säljer redan nu, och att det kanske inte blir någon squeeze överhuvudtaget då.

Allt som allt så är det ju en nog så jävla riskabel investering, men chansen finns ju att tjäna kosing. Men sen beroende på din politiska åsikt kanske det egentligen är viktigare att man rubbar till aktiemarknaden, vilket är absolut ett perspektiv jag kan sympatisera med. Jag undrar verkligen vilken effekt man hade kunnat få ifall man organiserat bättre, kanske nån sorts kollektivt ägd fond eller om man hade kunnat organisera det genom en fack-liknande förening och göra det som en aktiemarknads-strejk.</text>

    <text>No worries! I guess it depends on how they are taking the short position. If they are borrowing shares to sell short, then it is as described. 

If they are using option strategies, again, it depends on how they did it, but in some instances all that happens is they lose out on the option premium.</text>

    <text>The guy who lended the stock is not involved. He is safe.

What happened was that your friend sold your bike, that he had lended, to a third guy with the belief that he could buy it back cheaper later and return it.

Instead, the price for the bike went up exponentially and now you’re asking your friend where the fuck your bike is. So he will have to buy it at the massively inflated price to return it to you.

The owner never took any risks, the two people gambling was your friend and the third guy who bought the bike.</text>

    <text>Collateralized Debt Obligations.

In the case of the housing crash, it was mostly individual mortgages which were packaged up, then chopped up to have different risk/reward scenarios.  So you (or institutions rather) could buy CDOs that pay a certain amount of interest, backed by the individual mortgages of thousands of people.  The risk is that if too many homes foreclose, you're effed. But the highest risk, highest reward group would be effed first, then the next highest, etc.  

The sketchy part about the housing crisis was that banks took the highest risk, highest reward portion of bunches of CDOs, bundled them up together, and then sold them as low risk.

Then when the housing market crashed, all these "low risk" investments which were actually high risk became worthless.  "toxic assets"</text>

    <text>They basically sold the shares they borrowed and have to give back those shares after a period of time. Since they sold the share, hoping to buy it at a lower price later, they have to buy that share back at a higher price now. So instead of making money, they lose money. They have to put up collateral before even doing this kind of deal. So they're obligated to do something after a time period. They can't wait indefinitely. That's how I understand it.</text>

    <text>You seem to be spamming this response. Short is a variable word. The Big Short wasn't referring to a single short seller it was referring to short sales. Most people would say short sale for the noun form when referring to the activity, but sale/sell is commonly dropped from the activity when it's used as a word. Judging from the response of the asker it seems I was right about their intended usage.</text>

    <text>They weren’t really betting against anyone exactly. They were providing a service in exchange for a fee. They’re not really investors. Think of them as share custodians. They hold the shares for investors. Sometimes they lend out these shares to try and make some extra money. 

If the short squeeze didn’t happen, they would have made less interest since the short positions would have been closed out sooner, and they would have been returned the shares they loaned to the hedge fund. But I think they would rather be repaid then having to keep asking for collateral.</text>

    <text>It means that the number of shares that have been shorted is 124% of the total number of shares (more or less).

It can be higher than 100% because the same share can be loaned multiple times without anyone realizing it. You can borrow from me. You sell it to Bob. Bob loans it to Alice. Alice sells it to Tom. Tom lends it to George.

George, Alice, and you each owe someone a share. But only one share has circulated in this example.</text>

    <text>Basically, hedge funds are selling stocks they don't own and promising (legally) to buy them again at a later time. Their goal is to sell for current price ($10 or whatever) and then "buy" them back after they drive the price to $0.00 (killing the stock). A bunch of people on WSB said fuck those guys, let's buy stock and drive the price up. Legally, they have to buy the stock back. So now they're panicking because they "sold" for $10 or whatever, and suddenly they have to buy the stock back for like $400+. Each. And they're trading millions of shares.</text>

    <text>I don’t think this will be forgotten. What I hope doesn’t get lost or buried is the relationship that some of the “free” brokerages share with some hedge fund managers. 

Example: Robinhood sells order flow to Citadel Securities. This is millions of dollars in revenue for that startup, and one of the key reasons why they are free. TD and Schwab also do the same. 
  

https://fortune.com/2020/07/08/robinhood-makes-millions-selling-your-stock-trades-is-that-so-wrong/

Citadel security’s majority owner is Ken Griffen, whom manages Citadel (the hedge fund). Citadel gave Melvin (the hedge getting hosed) $2B on Monday exactly because of the losses incurred from this.

If so, what app should I use? There´s a trillion and I imagine quite a few are a scam. 

Apart from the obvious risk, is the stock climbing still? What is the most likely outcome? You lose the entire investment, we lose a chunk, we gain a bit? All depends on when you sell I suppose.</text>

    <text>Long isn't a measure of time -- it just means you're betting the price will go up.  One could hold for 5 minutes or 30 years.

In the case of GME, they know that a bunch of folks have shorted it, which means they HAVE to buy it back at some point to return to whoever they borrowed the shares from to short.  So it's like... bottled demand, kind of like how in science class, lifting a weight off the ground imparts potential energy.  That energy is going to come out at some point when the weight gets dropped.  

If the price goes high enough, the entity who lent the stocks to the short sellers may demand repayment immediately.  Short sellers would be forced to buy *at any price* in this scenario.

If the short sellers were smart, they would have also purchased call options (which gives them the right to buy N shares of the specified stock at  a specified price in a specified time frame) to hedge against this exact scenario happening, so their potential downside isn't... infinity.</text>

    <text>So they have lots of shorts, its not just one specific position and when the short comes due, they need to buy the stock at whatever market price is to return it to the owner. So the higher the price goes, thats what the hedge fund has to pay to make good on their short positions.</text>

    <text>&gt;This is analogous to saying that things may only ever be sold for profit, and never a loss. 

That is indeed what I'm saying. Besides highly convoluted financial markets, you can never sell something for a purpose of making a loss. 

Or at the very least, I can't think up of an analogy. But I'm willing to admit if I'm wrong and re-edited my original comment.</text>

    <text>It's more risky than investing, or in other words, a taking a 'long' position.

Theoretically a 'short' position has capped gains because the lowest a share's price can go is $0, while the highest a share's price can go is infinity.

Therefore the it is also true that going 'short' can generate infinite losses because what causes the position to lose is the share's price rising to a theoretical infinity, implying higher risk.</text>

    <text>It’s not that candy company does this, the purchaser of the candy does this. 

Funnily enough, they may not even be aware it happened. Since it might simply be a setting in the account where the broker gets to borrow their clients’ candy. Having a system in place to try to do it in a way where clients don’t experience the down side but they have signed the forms for having that type of account so they can’t complain if they do.

A downside would be wanting to sell my candy but can’t because someone borrowed it. Normally there is so much candy that they can replace my candy with the candy from someone else without me noticing. But if everyone wants their candy at the same time, that can’t happen but you agreed that you’d be fine with that when you started that type of account.

The upside for the broker is simple, they charge a small fee for this service.</text>

    <text>Companies don't lend shares. People who own shares lend them for interest. If you were not planning to sell your shares despite the price drop, it makes sense to lend them and get some interest income off otherwise idle assets.

Also it's a bad analogy. There's no candy company because companies don't exist for the sole reason of issuing shares. The underlying business is not affected by short selling unless they were planning to issue more shares to raise capital, in which case they'd end up raising less money than they otherwise would.</text>

    <text>In a day like yesterday where GME was up multifold, brokers would be demanding margin all through the day. Some hedge funds negotiate deals where brokers can't do that to them, but those are huge hedge funds with tons of assets they can post so even a multifold loss wouldn't crush them when they eventually post. Citadel is what, $50bn in AUM? Melvin capital is I think $8bn or $10bn? Yes they can absorb this hit, easily even.</text>

    <text>That actually isn't the same thing though. Even though 120% (or whatever the number is) of the shares are sold short now, each short seller could still be fully collateralized by their broker. In the funds account they would hold hundreds of positions, so the broker goes through each and says, ok 30% collateral for this one, 50% for this one etc. It's quite common for brokers to demand that high short interest positions be fully collateralized, I've even seen them demand over 100% collateral.</text>

Wsb realized that and figured they can buy shares and hold to increase price of shares which HFs would be forced to buy back.

    <text>Price at which a particular option is executed.

For instance a share is at $50 and you buy 1 call contract (100 shares per contract) at $70 strike, for a premium of $2/ share.

What this means is until the expiry you have a right to buy 100 shares of $7000. You paid $200 for this right. So you will only be profitable if the share price is above $72 when you exercise.

If the share price never crosses $72 at the time of expiry, you'll actually take a loss if you exercise because the market price is actually lower than the price at which you have a right to buy (the stike price). For instance, if the market prices is $60, you're overpaying by $12 if you exercise. So you'll let it expire worthless and lose $200 to the seller.

If the share prices crosses $72 and you exercise at $80, then you make a profit of $8 per share or $800 per contract, because you bought it at $72 from the seller, but the seller had to buy it at $80 from the open market to sell it to you. So you gain $800 from the seller.</text>

    <text>Yes, exactly. There are two types of orders: Limit orders and Market orders.

With a Limit order, you tell your broker "I want to buy X amount of this at Y price". The broker will post this to the exchange and anybody who sells it at that price, will accept your buy-offer. A lot of times people miscalculate by making a low-ball offer. You bid for a stock at $50 dollars, but the market goes up to $60. You make bid at $60 again, but the market goes up to $70, and so on.

With a Market order, you just tell your broker "gimme dat stock, at whatever price!!". This is basically meant to buy it at the 'current market price'. However, the risk of a market order is that you can't control the price. If the current market price is $50 and it immediately goes up to $400 once the market opens, you'll buy it at $400.</text>

    <text>That type of information is immaterial. The hedge funds are bleeding this money because they have millions/billions of dollars in short positions, a lot of that information is private or we don't know when the short positions expire since there are many contracts. GME is 120% shorted, the interest doesn't matter, all we know is they are bleeding and the longer people hold the more they bleed in interest payments or give up and close their position by buying the stocks. And when it's time to buy, that means demand increases, which fluctuates prices. If this information is new to you, I suggest buying GME or AMC, it spites the wealthy know it all class, who bet against these companies because they have outdated business models and are expected to go broke and file for bankruptcy, Wallstreetbets said fuck that and gave these companies an equity infusion by increasing their stock price.

    <text>&gt; Does it say in the obligation exactly at which date and time it needs to be given back? And if they don't give it back?

Some contracts do, some don't. If you don't give it back you'll probably get sued and/or fined by the SEC.

&gt; Also, how do they borrow stock?

They write a contract with a broker (or someone else who has access to the shares they want to short). The contract allows them to "borrow" a share, which they sell immediately. Thus they're no longer in possession of it. This is also what allows them to short more than 100% of available shares.

&gt;  Can someone short my stocks even if I'm not aware?

Yes, this is usually something your broker does that you may have to opt out of.</text>

    <text>As I understand it, they can't say that. 

Think of it like this:

* I borrow your zippo lighter, to be returned in three days, and I'll give you 10$ for using it.
* I then immediately sell your zippo to some rando.
* When the market value of zippo lighters has dropped by, say 20$ - which I believe was going to happen anyway - I buy it back at 20$ less than what I got for selling it.
* I now return your zippo and the promised 10$; and the extra 10$ goes in my pocket.

I cannot say sorry, I can't return your zippo - we're under contract. You'd sue the everliving fuck out of me and win, easily.

Now the hedge funds have done that with Gamestop stock; but WSB has managed to actually inflate the price by 100x. The funds will soon be required to return the stocks they borrowed; but because they sold them they will first need to buy fresh ones to return - at 100x what they got for the ones they sold.</text>

    <text>Hey DWHQ. My understanding is that a group of Reddit users cooperated to hype the value of an asset with no market instigation. This is, by definition, a pump and dump. Pump and dump is a form of securities fraud.

The question craywood asked was "why don't people just group together en masse"? The answer to that question is it is illegal. "What retail investors are doing right now" is a different question than what craywood asked. While I would argue that leaning into the big squeeze is trade manipulation, I would not hard accuse it as an act of illegality, but only because of the nature of the retail investor position.</text>

    <text>Yes, of course. You shouldn't buy Doge (or any other cryptocurrency) from these hedge fund apps like Robinhood.

Cryptocurrencies should be bought from crypto-exchanes. They offer much lower fees anyway and you don't support these hedge funds by giving them your fees.

Depending on which country you live, there are different exchanges to get Doge from. I recommend Binance, which is a great crypto exchange with a lot of different coins. However, it might be complicated to use for people with no exchange-experience

You can look at all the exchanges that list Doge coin here:

https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dogecoin/markets/

or here:

https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin#markets


The more volume, the better.

But I generally suggest not buying Doge while it's at its peak. Just wait for a dip. Otherwise you might end with a pretty hefty bag.</text>

    <text>Brokers require people short selling with them to post a certain amount of collateral so that they can make sure that they can buy shares. They have the discretion to change this amount of collateral if the stock becomes more volatile.

Force closing means the broker takes the collateral funds and buys with them to close out of their short position. 

Margin calls are similar in this aspect, they used to be literal phone calls but they just mean the broker is telling you that you don't have the posted collateral or don't have enough money in your account with them and if you don't fix it then the broker will force close your position.</text>

    <text>the difference is: these stocks exist unlike your PC.

Company A has 100 total shares.
Hedgefund B shorts (intends to sell) 200

now B can buy 50 stocks from an investor C, sell them (filling 50 out of their 200 quota), those get bought by investor D, and now B can buy 50 again from investor D and repeat the process (usually this happens a few days/weeks apart, so the stock value has time to go the way the hedgefund wants it to go).

you can sell more than 100% of shares if you just buy and resell the same one. it generally is a stupidly risky idea, which is why all these hedgefunds now got caught in their greedy behaviour and had to fear for their money for a while. (until robinhood and other trading apps came to help them out by limiting their users access to those stocks)</text>

    <text>Think of it as collateral. You can’t just borrow stock without anything to put up against it (the premium). When you borrow the stock, the stock owner charges you a predetermined amount, much like a monthly insurance premium. Using rounded numbers, let’s say the stock is $10, you think it’s actually worth $2. You borrow one, but the stock holder charges you a premium of $2. You sell for $10. Eventually it crashes to $2 (woo hoo you were right), so now you buy back at $2 to cover, and you walk with the difference, 10-2=8, 8-2(premium)=6. 

It doesn’t matter if the object is intangible. A car dealer won’t rent you a vehicle for free, so you can’t “rent” a stock for free.</text>

    <text>Kind of, yes. Normally in these short squeeze situations the hedge funds will buy back shares to eat up their loss and take the loss like a man. The thing here is that they DOUBLED DOWN on their short positions and DOUBLED DOWN AGAIN after share prices soared. What’s fucked up is they opened up a shit ton more short positions right before they had many brokerages suspend the stocks being traded, trying to drive the price down before they have to fulfill those positions. This is the 1% vs the 99% and the 99% are tired of being on the short end of the stick. Fuck the suits</text>

    <text>They can sell any time. Usually the brokerage handles that, so if you sell your share it pulls it out of the pool of shares the broker has to lend out. 

Usually they just borrow from someone else to cover the share that was lent. If there are not enough shares to borrow then the lender must close their position (ie buy a share to pay back the one they borrowed).</text>

    <text>No, they need to buy it back later to pay for the stock they originally ‘borrowed’ and on-sold.  They’re hoping the stock price has fallen as that’s how they make their profit.  

E.g. if they on-sold the stock for 20$ a share and now they can buy it for 5$ a share to pay back then they’ve just made 15$ a share in profit. But if it’s gone up to 50$ a share and the time to pay back is now due then they have no choice but to buy at 50$ - which means a loss of 30$ a share.</text>

If you sell it at $10 and it goes down to $1 and you buy it at 1 you made $9 thats why you want the stock to fall so you have to spend as little money as possible</text>

    <text>No, it's like imagine you borrowed a stock for $10 then sold it immediately for $10. Then you'd have $10, but you still need to buy it later cuz you just sold something you're only borrowing.

So you wait and then the stock price falls to $6 because the company is doing poorly. So then you go and buy that stock you borrowed for $6. If you take the $10 you made originally from selling it right away minus the $6 you actually bought it for, you now have a $4 profit. 

So "short selling" is when you borrow a stock at a certain price, sell it at that price, then actually buy it later hoping the stock prices goes down. You're basically hoping the company does poorly and their stock price goes down from when you originally bought and sell it so that you can buy it for real at a cheaper price. You're betting against the company.</text>

    <text>You borrowed a stock worth 30$.
You sold that stock for 30$.
You wait a week and buy it back for 10$.
You give back the borrowed stock worth 10$.


You made 20$.

It's essentialy "buy low sell high" but in reverse - you sell high and then buy low.</text>

    <text>Basically you borrow the stock off someone else and sell it, hoping to buy it back later for cheaper.

Ie I'll borrow GME off you, sell it at market which might be $18. Once GME crashes, I'll buy it back (eg at $6) and give you your GME stock back but I keep the $12 difference.</text>

    <text>It allows you to get better leverage. If Amazon is $1k a share, how can you participate in any meaningful way to take advantage of the stock movement if you have a limited budget? If you think it's going to go up, you buy a Call contract, which is the right to buy 100 shares. But you don't have to cough up $100k to do it. You pay the premium. If the stock actually goes up, you make money, minus the premium. If it goes down, you're out the premium. But you're not out $100k. You're out just the premium you already paid to control those stocks.</text>

    <text>There are and if there aren’t if the momentum is there they will be created. Moreover a lot of people are not selling their stock. Which means that hedge funds can’t cover all their short positions because there isn’t enough stock to go around.  

This is even worse than you think because there are 140% shorted gme stock. That is they have shorted more stock than there actually exists.  

How you may ask? Well ask the SEC how the fuck naked shorting is still allowed.</text>

At this point I think brokerages are starting to realize the eyes of the world are on them. They hate that, they prefer doing their thing under the radar. Politicians are salivating at the thought of a slam dunk move (going against the brokerages) that will make all their constituents happy. Both sides of the political isle are aligned against a common enemy right now and it's kind of crazy to see.</text>

don’t forget though that doge can always be traded 24/7 since it’s a cryptocurrency, so really get that price going while there’s no limitations on it. it’s the cheapest and it could potentially have the most potential bc of the no limitations and the fact that we can buy over the weekend.

    <text>When you market order it pretty much instantly takes the best available order from the opposite side of the book. So say there was an ask at 100$ for 100 shares and you bought 10 shares at market, it would fill at 100$ and the order book at 100$ would go from 100 to 90 shares available.</text>

    <text>1) The time frame is negotiated between the borrower and lender, there is usually no "standard" time frame.  Although the Lender reserves the right to demand the stock to be returned at any time for any reason with little notice but thats usually bad for business as others wont be as willing to borrow from them in the future.

2) ~~Yes the shorts are expiring soon, most likely sometime next week. The panic is caused by to major reasons. The first being the shorts expiring soon, the second is that the~~ hedge fund managers shorted 140% of available stock.

EDIT: I should state that shorts do not expire but the borrower has to pay the lender interest everyday until the short is covered, meaning all of the borrowed stock is returned. So while technically the hedge fund managers could wait until the hype is down, they would owe a metric ton of interest to the lender.</text>

    <text>We can only assume. I think it’s fair to say that the initial shorts (Citron, Melvin) were likely ready to hold their short positions for a very long time. But obviously the second thing happened.

For the second point, you’re pretty much spot on. There are safeguards in place to make sure that you cannot keep shorting if you don’t have the money to lose, so that’s why a lot of shorts, including some of the early ones, were forced to capitulate.</text>

    <text>Yea. They way to think about it is margins are a loan from your broker. You put in $5,000 of your own cash and your broker lends you $5,000 so your total trade is $10,000, that is trading on margin. Example, You lend someone $20 and now you see they lost their job they have unpaid bills so you start thinking woah he may not be able to pay my $20 back in a week, so you go to him and say Hey I want my $20 back now. Thats a margin call.

 As the price of gamestop continue to go up the more risk the lender takes on, the more risk the lender takes on the more they want their money back and thats the squeeze.</text>

    <text>Bitcoin is a decentralized payment system (cryptocurrency) and the value of each Bitcoin is determined by how much people are willing to pay for or accept one (bid/ask spread). In many ways it is very similar to stocks in that you can buy and sell both of them for profit (trade their prices) but with Bitcoin you can use the coin itself to buy things, you can’t say to a store clerk “Hey I’ll give you five shares of Twitter for those cigarettes” even though some select stores would let you pay with crypto. Wallstreet refers to anyone who works in the market, market makers (don’t worry about what they do), hedge funds (big firms that gather a lot of money from investors and then use that money to buy or short a lot of stocks, called a portfolio), SEC (people who regulate everything and make sure there’s no fraud) employees, etc. Right now the average trader like you or me is winning which is very uncommon as these hedge funds are very used to winning. Who will win? Who knows, probably the hedge funds though, which will piss off many people but it’s the way the market works</text>

    <text>&gt;Who do they borrow it from?  

They borrow from brokers.  

&gt;How is borrowed and not bought?  

Think of it as borrowing money from a bank. That money isn't yours, you have to pay it back (+ interests) at some point, but in the meantime you can do whatever you want with it.  

The difference with shorts is that you enter a contract promising to give back the same number of *shares* you borrowed from the broker, not a fixed monetary value. So you borrow shares at a time they're expensive, sell them for a high price, then hope the price drops, buy at a low price, and give them back to honor your contract, pocketing the difference (minus interest).</text>

    <text>Ill try again :)  
When someone shorts a share it means they BORROW shares and sell them to someone at the current price. They promise (contract) to buy the actual shares they borrowed at a certain date in the future.   
So what does that mean? That means if the share price is now 10 and they borrow 100 shares and sell them they have made 1000. In a week the price has dropped to 5, which was their prediction that is why they borrowed shares to sell (SHORTING) and the time has now come for them to actually buy the shares they promised to buy, so they buy the 100 shares for 5, but see this only cost them 500 and they sold the shares they borrowed for 1000 so they have made 500 profit.   
But when people realize that you are shorting a share, they might not like you and so they want to hurt you, so what they do next is called a short squeeze:  
Instead of agreeing with the person shorting and also selling their shares cause you agree the price will go down you STAND UP and say NO, that is bullshit there is nothing wrong with this company, the only reason the price is dropping is because of the hedge funds selling so many shares (shares they must still buy remember, but hopefully at  lower cost as the price drops as they sell)   
What is happening now is everyone and their dog is buying GME stocks to counteract this short position of the hedge funds.  
So people are shortsqueezing the hedge fund by driving the price up. 

But how does this hurt them? Well by buying so many shares they are driving the price up, so the shares that were 10 are now 1000. Remeber the hedge fund still needs to buy these 100 shares they borrowed to sell. 

OK so lets pretend today is the day that contractually they need to buy the shares (the ones they sold which they didn't even have, they borrowed them remember) now they HAVE to buy the shares at market value which is 1000 now. so they made 1000 selling the borrowed shares but now they must buy them so they have to buy 100 shares at the current price which is not 50 like they were hoping it is 1000. So they need to spend 100 x 1000 = 100 000.

They sold for 1000

But had to buy back later for 100 000

so they have lost 99 000 on the deal. The higher the price goes the more they are losing to infinity. 

Currently one of the hedge funds is down 70 Billion dollars or so....</text>

    <text>That’s exactly it - some of the top comments explain better too, but basically the purpose of them “shorting” the stock was they borrowed a stock at say $10 value and promised to give it back. They sell it for $10 and plan to buy it at $5 when it dips and give that back to who they borrowed it from. Doing this with enough stocks can make a ton of money. 

The best practice for investing is absolutely to buy low, plan long term, and sell high if you wish; but hedge funds are often out for quick gains and so shorting stocks are what they tend to do.</text>

    <text>When you short a stock you're not actually selling it. You borrow the stock, sell it a a high price, buy it back at a lower price, pocket the proceeds, and give the stock back to the entity you borrowed it from. The shorting entity never really owns the stock to begin with.</text>

    <text>Let me break down your questions to see where the confusion is - but keep in mind I’m Not An Expert, and there are great explanations at the top of this thread. 

So, a lot of people WOULD NOT want to buy the stock at 100 and sell it at 50 - that just gives you a net loss. What it does for the market does make that stock go down because you sold - think of the principle of supply and demand. If we have 100 carrots and 50 people want a carrot, we can reasonably sell them for $2 a piece and everyone is happy. But if one person has more money and buys 50 carrots, then 49 people still want the remainder of the carrots and will have to pay closer to $4 per carrot. And the opposite is true still- let’s start with 100 carrots, but a farmer grew too many, and now there’s 200 carrots, but only 50 people, so they can buy a carrot for $0.50 or $1 to adjust to having too many (think about why it’s exciting to buy more of something when it’s on sale even when you don’t need it, and also how you opt to NOT buy something that’s too expensive unless you need it).

So to answer your second question: THAT wouldn’t. Third: no.

Last question: if a lot of people buy, again with the carrots, then yes the price would go up. 

So look at it this way to. What happened with GameStop is that they have 100 shares (for example) of stock on the market. Hedge funds with billions of dollars decided the company was probably on its way out, so they *borrowed* 95 stocks at $10 a piece, planning to sell them when the value expected to drop enough that they’d make their money and run. 

Since they borrowed these stocks, they needed to return them, but they wanted to profit so they’d wait until the value went to $5. But what happened in reality is a couple of things: not only did someone on reddit notice that they didn’t even short (borrow) a lot of stocks, they borrowed *140* - literally 40 more stocks than *exist* on the promise that they’d buy them back. That coupled with the fact that they made a gamble with naked shorts - which means essentially that there was no limit on their buy back price, from my understanding, made them very vulnerable, and reddit got that out. 

So now the “retail investors” (us) purchased all of the remaining available stock (the 5 from the original 100, per se) and the 95 the hedge funds sold hoping to gain on, and now there are NO stocks left which is driving the price infinitely higher because at some point the hedge funds have to return the stock they borrowed, paying out the retail investors who would then be willing to sell.

It’s a lot, I know. There’s not a lot of ways to simplify it further so I hope I helped!</text>

    <text>It Will only go down after they buy all of it, which, if market rules apply, means the stock Will go up a lot more. 

Picture this. There's only 10 Cars in the world.

They belong to Peter.

John sells those Cars to Andrew, even thought he doesn't own them.

John makes money if the cars are worth less when he buys them back and gives it back to Peter.


But this Cars are all Teslas with FSD, and they actually increase in price. John pays interest to Peter for the difference of price, until he pays Peter back.


But now Andrew sees that John fucked up. He needs to get the cars back or else he Will pay interest for ever.


Andrew decides the cars are now worth 5000x more because he has all of the cars and John needs it back now! He's also pissed at John because John called Andrew dumb for buying Tesla's


Not the first time this happens on the market. But it's the first time that John actually sold 14 Cars, when only 10 existed. He created fake Cars that are also now worth 5000x more even if they don't exist</text>

    <text>So this is where people getting in don’t understand the background and are getting confused by what’s happening. Imagine the difference between a credit card and a debit card. One is you using credit to buy things and pay the card back and one is you using your own funds. As this has been a volatile situation, different brokers have been requiring people use less credit and more debit. Today people who were using credit got their shares sold so they were back on their own debit(no longer buying on margin)</text>

    <text>Because hedge funds only do shorting when they bet that a company is going to bankruptcy, and then they have an incentive to make that happen so they manipulate the market and the media so the company actually goes to bankruptcy.

Normally you buy stock and you will be better if the company is better. With shorting you are selling before buying, so you will be better when the company does bad, so you have an incentive to make that happen.</text>

    <text>a lender "lends" you an apple, and you sell that apple to someone for $2.00. You did that because you're going to buy an apple later because you think apples are going on sale for $1. However, you were wrong, and apples go up to $100. You can't afford an apple now, you only have $50. Your lender now is out their apple. This is a basic failed short scenario (with a margin issue- explained later). As you can see, there is this "magic amount" (in this case $50), that can be exceeded when you can't return your loaned apple.

In a lot of people's mind, stocks are just "bought" and then they go up or down, and the most you can "lose" is the amount you paid. In complex trading, this is not the case, you can lose more than you ever put in, in buying or selling scenarios. Imagine your wallet, and the amount in it compared to the amount you have been lent. This is called margin. If the margin gets too tight, the lender does a "Margin Call" and forces you to liquidate, or add money into the deal.

So robinhood is lending money to customers effectively. There is a margin, and depending on the types of orders made by the customers, robinhood might say "the risk of you losing more money than you can afford is too great, we are closing your position". This is because robinhood has to pay any additional money to their overlords ("clearing house" in many interviews).

That's all bullshit though because robinhood stopped standard buy orders (ones with cash, like the most basic concept of "buying a stock"), because they are swindling wallstreetbets, because major firms own them. They are just using all this margin mumbo jumbo to confuse the general public into thinking they are acting responsibly. They did close some accounts that were getting risky, but they were preventing buy orders entirely, which is bullshit..</text>

    <text>&gt;Why is short selling perceived as evil?

When you buy a stock, you are hoping for the company to do better. Your literal financial well being is based on them being good and their stocks going up.

&amp;#x200B;

When you short a stock, it is the opposite. You hope that the company is hit by an asteroid and is burnt to smithereens. Every dollar that the stock loses, is a dollar going into your pocket.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;What is gamma squeeze and how is it different from short squeeze?

I don't know this for certain, but I believe a short squeeze is when you squeeze someone on stocks and a gamma squeeze is when you squeeze someone on options.</text>

    <text>Short Selling is betting that the company will decrease in value which I suppose is a little harsh, but that's not particularly the problem. The problem is that many of the more well-known managers of Hedge-Funds frequently go on TV or frequently write for or even own newspapers with the sole purpose of talking down companies for no other reason than they have bet they will fail. So if they talk enough shit about a company the hopes is that the word will get out and the value will decrease.

Some even take it a step further and look for legal avenues to hollow out businesses and watch them crumble for a quick buck.

A short-squeeze is when people who have shorted the stock rush to buy back the stock at a loss before their losses become even greater. This forced the share price to skyrocket because of the mass buying.

A gamma-squeeze is for those that never bought the shorted stock back and are waiting for the whole thing to blow over. A gamma-squeeze occurs when these people are *forced* to buy back their stock because the person who they borrowed shares from are calling in their debts. Once again, skyrocketing the value of the stock.

Edit: Just for clarity, a Short-squeeze is when people willingly take the loss and buy back the stock. A Gamma-squeeze is when they are forced to buy it back as their debts are being called in.</text>

    <text>So when you trade, you trade on the stock exchange (usually). You put in an order to buy or sell at a certain price, that goes to the exchange. If a compatible order is found (both of you agree on the price), the trade then goes to a clearing house, which organizes the actual exchange of money and shares.

From my understanding, the problem isn't the fees, it was the collateral they needed to put up. Before they can send your money, the stock exchange "fronts" their money. And Webull just couldn't handle the amount of fronting they needed to do.</text>

    <text>When you short a stock, there is something called initial margin and maintenance margin. When you short the stock, you need to deposit a certain amount with the broker as your initial margin (often 50% of the short value). If the stock price rises enough that you drop below the maintenance margin, you must deposit funds with the broker to get you back up to the initial margin. This is essentially whats happening to the hedge funds (unless they close out the position at a loss)</text>

    <text>Its important to understand that there is a finite amount of stock available for any company. Sure, they can issue more, but it doesnt happen all that frequently. A stock is essentially just ownership of a small piece of a company. I like to imagine a company's value as a pizza pie, and your stock is a set portion of that pie. Lets pretend a company has just 8 shares that can be owned (like a real pizza). This pizza happens to cost 16 bucks total.

Shorts are basically agreed upon loans of stock. If you are a short seller, you are making an agreement with someone that they will loan you 1 piece of pizza today today, and you must give them 1 piece of pizza back in exactly 7 days. For the right to get that pizza today you give him a quarter. Why would you agree to do that? Well you believe the price of the pizza is going to drop all the way from 16 bucks to 8 bucks. So each slice will drop in price from 2 bucks to 1 buck. In your head you can pay a quarter today, to then earn 1 dollar in a week, essentially netting 75 cents. 

Every time a stock is traded, the buyer &amp; seller each think they're fucking the other guy over. So the guy who lent you the pizza thinks that the price of a slice is either going to go up, stay the same, or drop a very small amount (he thinks the most it will drop is by 25 cents per slice, hense why he was willing to agree to this deal for a quarter).  

Now some of these more agreesive funds were making lots and lots of these deals. There are only 8 slices of pizza that can by held, and they were making deals with 12 people at a time. Now I figured that out, and I'm going to buy as many of the slices as I can. Suddenly your 1-week long deals are soon to expire, and im aware of this. I dont have any reason to give you the pizza, but you are desparate to get it because if you don't agree to the deal you'll face heavy charges. Suddenly you're paying me 10 bucks a slice just so you can get out of all these deals you made.</text>

    <text>Basic law of supply and demand, you HAVE TO BUY IT BACK!!! If you short the stock that means you borrowed the stock and have to return it, for every day you don't return the stocks you are paying interest. It's a tough situation for short sellers.</text>

    <text>For ordinary people your broker will require you to be long stocks (opposite of shorting, or regularly owning) a certain percentage in your account. Then they can go in and sell your securities if you can't cover the needed stock. I think there are some rules around naked shorts like these hedge funds did, where smaller investors simply aren't allowed because the can't handle the unlimited loss potential.</text>

    <text>Essentially a short seller does the following:

You borrowed a Share last year at some point for the price of what was then 5$ and sold it straight away. You now have 5$ cash, but need to return the share to the company you borrowed from at some point. You also pay some small interest on the borrowed share for the period you borrowed it for. The goal for doing this is that you are betting the share price will go down in future, so when you need to return the share you borrowed, you can actually buy it at a lower price and return it. 

Say everything goes to plan and two months later the price is 4 dollars, you’d go buy the share for 4$ and give it back to the person you borrowed it from in the first place. This means you made 1$ profit from borrowing the share (minus some interest you pay for borrowing the share).

It becomes problematic when the share price doesn’t go down. When it goes up, and you end up buying the share back at say 6$, you end up making a loss of 1$. 

Keeping in mind that you absolutely have to return the share at a certain point, because that’s what your borrowing contract says, we start to see how a short squeeze can happen. If it becomes public knowledge that a share is heavily shorted and it gets closer to the date at which you need to return it, people may not be willing to sell the share to you because they know you have to buy at essentially whatever price the market says because you need to return the share to the company you borrowed it from.

A share price is always a balance of ask vs bid, essentially supply and demand. You can make a bid to the market to buy that share for 4$, but no one has to tell to you. And if others don’t want to sell at a lower price, the share price calculated by the exchange (e.g. NYSE) goes up.   

What is currently happening is that very few people are willing to sell, because they know there are a few companies that borrowed A LOT of shares for shorting, and need to return them. But since no one is willing to sell, the share price keeps going up and up. 

Eventually people will say that they have made enough of a return by not selling their shares, and will start selling to the people who need to return their shares, but at a much much higher price than what you originally borrowed it for (the price of $5 last year when you borrowed your share, is now $350, meaning you make a $345 loss on every single share). That is why shorting can be very dangerous and risky, because the potential for losses on a short share are essentially infinite. You are bound by contract to return the share and will need to buy at whatever price the market says. 

As to what happens when you cannot pay that much for a share, that’s essentially bankruptcy. You have a lot of debt mounted up and have to declare bankruptcy. 

There are a number of knock on effects as well (the bank you borrowed the share from, is still missing it’s share Even if you go bankrupt, so they can also go bankrupt etc.) but that’s more than ELI5 level.</text>

    <text>If someone shorts a stock they "borrow" a stock and sell it straight away on the stock market, with a contract saying you have to give the stock back at a certain date. 

If you're expecting a stock to go down in value, you can short it to make money. If a stock is worth 40$ at the moment, you can borrow a stock and sell it for 40$. If the value of the stock goes down by 10$ by the time you need to give the stock back, you buy the stock for 30$ and hand it back. You'll have made 10$ minus the fees paid. 

Since the shorts are expiring they have to buy it back. Normally this isn't that big of an issue, but since the amount of shorts is insanely high (higher than the amount of stocks that are available to trade) the people who hold the stocks can pretty much set their own ridiculously high price. 

As for what happens if they can't I'm not too sure.</text>

    <text>Do you know how short selling works? They basically borrow stocks they don‘t own in return of an interest to sell them at market price in hopes the price will fall. They can only borrow the stock for a certain period of time after which they have to return them. In case the stock price went down, good for them, they make profit because now they can rebuy those borrowed stocks that they had sold earlier at a lower price. But short selling is highly risky because stock prices in theory could rise infinitely. When that happens they potentially may lose an infintite amount, because they have to return the borrowed stock they had sold earlier. Now the price is much higher and they lose money. This is why short selling is prohibited in many cases and highly regulated. When you bet on rising prices, all you may lose is what you put in but if you bet on falling prices, there is no limit to your loss in case the price doesn‘t actually fall. I hope that‘s not too confusing.
So now that large hedgefonds borrowed stocks, sold them and hoped the prices would plummet, they still have to rebuy those stocks. The market dictates the price. It‘s just a matter of when they have to return those stocks. The longer they keep them, the more interest they have to pay as well. So either they wait in hopes the price will go down and pay interest rates or they buy now in fear of prices going up even further.</text>

    <text>The hedge funds loaned those stocks from someone else, and will have to give them back at some point. Usually they do this with stocks with decreasing value. For example, they loaned the stock, sold to someone for X dollars, bought this stock back a week later for half of X, gave the stock back to the loaner and pocketed the difference in stock value. That's short selling, making money when a stock loses value.

What happened which Gamestop is that people realized that most of stocks available were loaned by someone else, and at some point those loans need to be paid back. So, if the hedge funds try to buy the stocks, and people refuse to sells their stocks, the prices will go up. It's pure supply and demand, the demand starts to increase as the hedge funds are looking for those stocks, and the supply decreases as people hoard those stocks.</text>

    <text>When someone shorts a stock, they are selling a borrowed stock. That means the borrower will have to return the stock after a period of time. But for the period of time they have borrowed it, they would have to pay interest. 

After a certain point in time, the interest payment becomes too significant. So the borrower does not have a choice but to buy the stock at current price, and return it. This is done to avoid further interest payment.</text>

    <text>Not really, once the company has sold its shares on the market, the increase in the value of those free float shares benefits only the investors themselves, not the company.

But there are clear benefits to a higher share price, most of which are related to good public and stakeholder perception, which creates a virtuous cycle of higher stakeholder and public perception. 

In addition, companies can also use a portion of their authorized (not issued capital) in employee contracts, which is called Employee Stock Option Programs (ESOPs). Very common practice in tech companies.</text>

    <text>A short position is when you sell stock you don't actually own, and by a certain date have to fulfill that obligation. The hope is that in that future date the price is cheaper. So you sell high today, buy low in the future.

It's just the nature of a short, that they will eventually be forced to buy what they've promised to give to someone else.</text>

    <text>&gt; Is there a hard deadline for them to return shares? Could they renegotiate their position and such that they returned shares later?

The deadline is today, after that they have start paying interest on the shares until they can return them. So they then have to gamble on which is going to cost more, waiting for the price to drop and paying the interest or buying at the inflated price and cutting their losses. either way they lose money.

&gt; how will we know that they really are causing billions in losses?

Whatever happens now the short will be squeezed, the shorters will lose money, but putting an exact figure is impossible.</text>

    <text>I’m not sure what you mean by shortening. If you want to short a stock, that is a specific type of trade and I only recommend it for advanced traders. If you want to set a buy a stock at a certain price and/or sell it at a certain price, you can create a buy limit order at a certain price and when it is fulfilled, you can set a sell limit at a much higher price. You can set a stop loss where it would automatically sell if the stock goes below a certain price to make sure you don’t lose too much money.</text>

    <text>To add to ghostrunner. The way they bet that the stock will go down involves initially borrowing stock from a lender and selling it immediately for price A.

At a certain time later, when the stock is valued less, they plan to buy the stock back at a lower price B and then return the stock to the lender.

However there are two things to note:

1.) These hedge funds got greedy and borrowed more stocks than is available. This is illegal and there should be an investigation.

2.) Because of the limited supply of stocks (see pt 1), everyday they miss returning the stock back to the lender they incur a large fee.

So then all these firms will need to buy back stock at inflated prices due to lack of supply. Everyone who has a share is basically guaranteed to have a buyer which is what is causing the craziness.

All the people betting (shorting) that the stock will tank has lost +60 billion so far (on paper I think)</text>

    <text>Think about it this way - they 'borrowed' $10 of stock and got the money for it, so now they have $10, but because they sold someone else's stock, they need to give them their share of the money... so they wait for the stock to drop to let's say $5... then they pay the people the $5 for their share and they get to keep the other $5 dollars and that's how they make money by 'shorting' stocks. 

So... they borrowed 120%-140% of publicly available stock at $10 and got maybe a couple of billion and then they are waiting for the stock to drop to return the stock at $5 again... but WSB started buying pushing the stop up, and now it's worth (for this example) $100 and they have to pay back the borrowed stock... mean they now owe 10's of billions to pay it back - and since they borrowed 120%-140% of available shares.... they are up shit creek without a paddle owing the stock holders (being WSB retail buyers, regular people) about 70 billion dollars or something like that. 

So that's a terrible explanation of what's going on.</text>

    <text>Right now it looks like the price will climb to the roof/moon for GME. But somewhen it's going to turn and coming back down. Predicting that point (the peak) is impossible.  
I'm a retard and this is not financial advice. Just so I won't get sued.</text>

    <text>If you are worried and talking about a considerable amount, I'd suggest talking to a lawyer or professional financial adviser to secure your gains.

I, and most likely most of the people here on reddit, can't answer that question, it depends on way too many factors (your country, your broker, the type of gains, local laws, potential laws to come after this whole thing is over, etc.)</text>

    <text>My understanding is that the shorts have a deadline by which the hedge funds need to give the shares back they’ve borrowed.

If we never sell, I assume there’s some mechanism to force the hedge funds to pay compensation or similar, which could end up being very costly.</text>

    <text>1. What you're describing is more like a bond, where you literally lend money to a company to gain interest. A stock buys you entitlement to a piece of the (equity of) the company. You're a part owner of the company and earn a fraction of the profit. You generally don't sell your stock back to the company but rather other investors who are interested in buying it.

2. When people are betting on stocks they're speculating instead of real investing. Speculating is done short term and the investments are done purely based off of short predictions and market trends. Long-term investing requires you looking into the financial health of a company instead of market trends.</text>

    <text>If nobody sells then the value will remain the same.

However, what is likely happening is that many people will sell because they are not wanting to play chicken with their savings so it's likely it will decrease slowly. But if most people hold then Wall Street will have to buy back their shares if they haven't already. Temporarily driving the price high before likely crashing back down again.

The idea is to hold until Wall Street is forced to pay their debts.</text>

    <text>Anyone who bought stocks, yes. There were a few hedge funds that short sold the stock - essentially selling someone else's stock right away with a plan to buy it back later, hopefully at a lower price. Those people are out millions and potentially billions of dollars, but many other people are making money hand over fist</text>

    <text>Which is what the hedge funds did. They said “what if we took this $100 bill, and light it on fire. It’s probably gonna get us more. But if the trade goes the opposite way we want, we contractually agree to back this entire dump truck of $100s right on to that tire fire over there. And if our friends at the other hedge fund make the same bet, then we agree to order dump trucks of cash until we can put out the fire.”</text>

    <text>The only way to benefit is to have stock, and selling it, either to the hedge fund directly, who is forced to buy to cover their margin.  Or to another retail investor who is buying in the hopes that the hedge fund will need to pay even more to cover their margin.</text>

    <text>Gamestop is not directly benefiting. They could choose to create more shares and sell them at these ridiculous prices. They likely won't as that's a bit of a legal grey area they'd probably rather avoid.

And yes, anyone who's bought low and sold higher. People who are still holding have what's called unrealized profits. They could sell for a profit, but they haven't so it's more of a what-if.</text>

    <text>The people who hyped the value of the asset up initially benefitted from a traditional position called a long call. This is just buying an asset and holding it, waiting for it to increase in value.

Future beneficiaries include those who are either shorting the stock or engaging in an options contract expecting the bubble to eventually deflate back to the original value, leaving many Reddit users on the hook with a very expensive asset that is actually worthless. Worse: Wall Street will likely be the one to collect.</text>

David, who now owns shares, decides that they will offer to lend his shares to someone else. Brad comes along and decides to borrow the shares, selling them to engage in a short position.

    <text>Hedge funds aren’t responsible for companies being publicly traded. Companies make that decision when they decide to go public and sell shares on the market. They do this to raise capital when they need it to do business operations.

Hedge funds are just one player in the game. They invest in these companies like mutual funds, regular traders and other institutions do. A Hedge fund is basically a company that manages money for a group of investors. This means that people or institutions(such as college endowments or pensions) give money to the hedge fund so they can make a return on their assets, for this service the hedge fund gets a fee. This is similar to a mutual fund except hedge funds are only open to really rich people and big institutions. 

For the second part of your question:

Sometimes companies are in really bad shape, this means that they are losing money or about to go bankrupt. When this happens people don’t want to own stocks in such companies because they aren’t valuable anymore so they begin to sell, when many people sell, the price of the stock goes down. 

When a hedge fund thinks this will happen to a business they can do something called shorting, this means they bet that the company stock will keep falling. They don’t care to keep the company afloat because they would make money if it fails when they short.

To short the stock they first borrow shares at the current price and then sell them immediately. The hedge fund will then have to hope the stock price will keep falling. If it does they will buy it back at a lower price and return the shares to the place they borrowed it from. 

If that doesn’t make too much sense here is another explanation. Say I want to short a company, first I will borrow shares of that company and let’s just say the shares are 100 dollars each. I will borrow 10 shares for 100 dollars each and then sell them immediately which means I now have 1000 dollars. If all goes well the price of the stock I’m shorting falls. Let’s say it falls to 10 dollars per share. This is great for me. Since I borrowed the shares I need to return them to the person I borrowed them from. So what I do now is buy back 10 shares for 10 dollars each which means I spend 100 dollars. I return the shares to the people I borrowed from but I get to keep 900 dollars because I originally sold the shares and made 1000 but I only need to return the 10 shares which are worth 10 dollars. 

I hope that helps and please someone correct me if I’m wrong I’m not an expert on this stuff

And also please let me know if I need to clarify anything, this stuff can get pretty complicated and I’m not sure if I’m explaining it good.</text>

    <text>You borrow one share from hedge fund A and short it by selling it straight to hedge fund B.

You then borrow the same share from hedge fund B, and short it by selling to hedge fund C.

You now owe both hedge funds A and B a share, but there’s only 1 share that’s circulating.

Now that share is 200% short.

From what I understand when they sell their shares for the time, let say at USD1/shares, if they sell 1mil shares, the company gain USD1mil.


But then what happen after that? Let say I bought 40,000 shares, means I have spent USD40k. And if someone is willing to pay USD2/shares, and I sell all my shares, I managed to get profit of USD40k. 


But what does that company get in return? It doesn't help the company at all, does it?</text>

    <text>Think of 2 football games:

1. The Football Championship Game in a huge professional stadium, to take place in a giant warm weathered city (The Big Game). The stadium fits 20 Million people.
2. An exhibition game in a tiny high school stadium, in a small arctic town (The Small Game). The stadium fits  20 thousand people.

Everyone wants to go to The Big Game, and prices for a ticket are $1,000 and rising.

However there really is no reason for anyone to attend The Small Game. Tickets are $10 and there is no reason to think they are going anywhere but down.

A short sale is an agreement to sell something for a future price.

So a person, lets says call him 'Shmedge' might 'short' the Small Game by saying "OK I promise to sell 20 thousand tickets to the Small Game, for the current price, $10. Shmedge's thinking is that by the time the game starts, people will be pretty much giving away tickets for $1, on account of no one having any interest in going. Shmedge's grand plan is to buy all the tickets for $1, sell them at the agreed upon $10, and make a cool $9 on each ticket. He does this for all 20 thousand tickets.

Now imagine some more facts come out about the Small Game. The stadium operator announces that they will be handing out free beer. It turns out it will be an unseasonably warm day that day. Two professional teams take the place of the high school teams that were supposed to play. A major airline starts operating flights to this small town. All of a sudden the Small Game is now **THE GAME.**

At this point, **EVERYONE** wants a ticket to the Small Game. However, since the stadium is so small, ticket prices rise fast. The diehard fans already have their tickets to the game, and fully intend to be there for kickoff. Since the stadium is so small to begin with, the ticket availability dries up fast. Now there are **no tickets** left to this once meaningless game. To try to get a ticket is to stand outside the stadium and ask all the people in the parking lots if they would consider parting with their golden tickets.

"Hey! You paid $10 for that ticket, what if I double it, give you $20? Nope? $40? $200? $400? Still nope? What do you mean you won't part with it? OK, well I'll keep saying numbers and you tell me if there is any number that will make you budge."

In the meanwhile, remember Shmedge? Well he still has an outstanding promise to sell 20 thousand tickets for $10/each, and kickoff time for the game is only drawing nearer. GUH.

TL:DR If you 'short' a valueless item, and that item then quickly picks up value, you are still on the hook to deliver that item.</text>

    <text>I have no idea the likelihood, but if a multi billion dollar hedge fund (or many of them) has to sell all their other stocks in other stocks to pay for GME stock to return to the folks who lent it to them... Then that could cause a loooot of stocks to go on sale at the same time, which could cause prices across the market to drop.

If the folks receiving all that money throw it right back into the market, it'd just be a hiccup.  If they're retail investors throwing it at other things (mortgages, student loans, car loans, new gaming PCs, whatever), then the market recovery would probably be slower, but probably boost the economy.  At least that's my reasoning.  But shit, I only have a high school diploma.</text>

    <text>Think of short selling like taking out a loan. You are essentially getting a loan on the asset which you typically sell immediately. You then have an obligation to pay back that asset, but just like an ordinary loan you owe interest/fees to whoever is loaning it to you. Therefore it's in your best interest to buy it back as soon as possible to reduce these fees. Also there's the pressure that if you keep waiting it will just rise further, which is the same psychological pressure on people holding assets but in reverse (which is what causes the downward spiral when people start dumping assets).</text>

FYI NASDAQ is a market, S&amp;P 500 is a list of 500 different companies (called an index) weighted by their value. When NASDAQ is referred to as an index, they're referring to the Nasdaq Composite index, which is a list of every stock on the nasdaq weighted by their value.</text>

    <text>Right. They’ve borrowed and sold a collective 140% of gamestocks stop trying to run them in the ground by betting against them. Given that a fair bit of stock is held up by long term investors and other folks such as those in WSB these stocks are going up. They’re rarer, and now funds like Melvin capital have to give the brokers their stock back so they can oblige to the calls they’ve sold. 

Well what do you do? They’re eventually required to buy back 140% of all available stock. But there’s not much stock, and as the stock goes up they’re required to give back more stocks, resulting in this escalation of price to whatever the stockholders want. 

They made a dumb bet with peoples money, they were reckless and have utilized the infrastructure they’re familiar with in nefarious ways to benefit themselves. 

They didn’t get punished in 08, and they didn’t learn. Not to mention there’s the possibility of naked shorts which are illegal.</text>

    <text>Investment managers funds are not inherently devious. However, as the old saying goes, “money corrupts.” This is being illustrated as we see unprecedented tactics on both sides of this argument. Factually, the hedge funds that are shorting $GME (Melvin Capital, Citron Research, Citadel LLC, etc.) have taken illegal action in the practice of purchasing naked shorts. Meaning that they have borrowed shares that don’t exist. So, yes, these hedge funds were irresponsible and likely driven by the desire to profit off of this deal.</text>

    <text>Essentially, imagine looking at a price. Let's say $5.00 
If you spend that $5.00 on a share, you raise the value of the next share purchase. 

If someone else sees that price and buys before you, you have lost the opportunity to buy a share for $5.00 
It now raises.

If someone sells their share (which may have been purchased at a lower or higher price) during the time you are looking at this $5.00 price, it will lower the cost of the share.
It now falls.

High market velocity is "surfed" on the backs of foolish plebs who have purchased their shares after you. 

Your enemy is the people selling. You want to sell before them, because when they sell, it lowers the prices.

Notice you are both these parties. In essence, the stock market is a digital manifestation of hype.

Because you can now purchase fractions of a share and crypto currency
"Huh, I'm interested in that, I'll click like." 
Is the way to go. Think early facebook where you "liked" every thing you were into. Replace "like" with "put a dollar or a thousand into assuming other people will like it" and you essentially have the formula to success.

These days, people are sending droves to the market from a single tweet. If you liked it before it was cool, you're more valuable.</text>

    <text>The idea behind the whole thing is that eventually, the funds that shorted will be forced to purchase the stocks, no matter what price they are.

With the amount of stocks shorted, it could trigger a huge stock price jump.  

At some point, people will jump out and sell, hopefully the firms that shorted the stocks are the ones left holding the stocks that they will have paid WAY more for them they are worth.</text>

    <text>They lose two ways. 

One is they have to buy shares at higher price than they pay. So they lose it to other investors. 

 But they also have to give back the shares they borrowed. So let’s say they owe 100 shares but because of the price they only have enough to buy 20 shares. That means they have to either kill the price (which they did today by preventing us from buying on RH) or they have to come up with the funds to by the shares. Which means selling their other stocks. Which is why traditional investors are scared of the ripple effect this could have. Now these hedge funds are going to have to dip into their portfolios and release massive amounts of stocks in other companies to make up for their shortage on GameStop. If they have to sell off other assets it could be enough to cause massive swings in other markets.</text>

    <text>About your first question, I'm wondering about that myself.

As for your second question, the people whose stocks they borrowed.   
Imagine having a candy bar. I think that they will go on sale for $1 in the store next week, right now they cost $3. So I'm like "I'll give you fifty cents to borrow your candy bar, you'll get it back next friday." Since you currently aren't hungry, you agree. 

So I take your candy bar and sell it for $2. If everything goes according to plan, the candy bars go on sale and I can buy one for $1. Minus the fifty cents I give you for borrowing your candy, I make fifty cents in profit. $2-0.5(for you)-$1(new bar)

Instead, the sale doesn't happen and the candy factory burns down. So the candy bars are now $4. My money: $2 sale-0.5(for you)-$4(new bar) which puts me at a loss of $2.5. And I HAVE to spend that $4 because you want your candy back. This is how shorting works.

Now imagine someone hates me enough to buy up all the candy bars and drive their price to $5 just to make me lose money. And that's what happened.</text>

I wouldn't be surprised if this happens. This will likely tank the stock and a massive risk to people bandwagoning that noone is talking about.

Unless there's a lot of GME execs that are short selling their own company, they'd be stoked with the increase in value of their own shares and are probably selling and taking profits as we speak.</text>

    <text>Yep. WSB is protected from the SEC for a few reasons. One of them is that no one knows nor can prove how much GME (or AMC/NOK/BB/etc) stock the subreddit collectively owns. On top of that, there's no evidence that the subreddit collectively decided to buy with intent to manipulate the price: at most, the subreddit encourages each other to buy and hold, which isn't any different from giving stock tips to people online. Those are still independant financial decisions made by different people. For the same reason, arguing that WSB is a hedge fund is ridiculous.</text>

Yes

&gt;What happens if the original owner of a shorted stock wants to sell the stock before the shorter has returned it?

Typically the exchange will just move the short to another person willing to lend. If there are truly none available, the broker will force close the short seller's position.</text>

They designed it in a way that market manipulation was just part of their business model.  They made a huge bet that GME would tank (and did it too blatantly), so all these “regular” people bet against the hedge fund (citadel).  The “regular” people actually pulled it off and beat the hedge funds at their own game and now they’re mad so they lied on cnbc to manipulate the public and when that didn’t work got trading suspended.

    <text>Also the more shares that are shorted, the more the interest rate goes up. Last I saw the interest rate for borrowing GME shares to short was somewhere in the 60-80% range. That's annually, of course, but that's still a significant amount of money per day when we're talking about positions that are worth 7+ figures.</text>

    <text>As I understand it:
You lend 100% of shares available and sell them. These shares are bought by whoever. Now you go to them and lend them again.

Of corse that can get a real big problem if you have to give the shares back. But if the company which shares you shorted is bankrupt the shares have a value of 0$ so you don't have to give anything back.
That's the gamble</text>

    <text>They pertain to options. Options are contracts to buy or sell 100 shares of a stock at a specific price no matter what price the stock is currently trading. That previously agreed on price is the strike price. 

The buyer of the option has the choice whether to exercise the option. They can do so at any point before or on a specific date. That date is the strike date, and if they don't exercise the option on or before that date is expires worthless which is expiry.</text>

* Calls: the price you are willing to buy shares at if it goes in the money
* Puts: the price you are willing to sell your shares if it goes in the money

    <text>No timeframe unless they get margin called by the people that loaned the stocks to them.

&gt;Why can't they just wait for the shares held by WallStreetBets users to be sold and let the market return to normal before buying back and returning to the lenders so they don't incur such grave losses?

Because part of the contract for shorting includes paying interest on the shares every day you don't give them back. If literally no stock moved tomorrow, the shorts still lose money on interest.</text>

    <text>Suppose someone "borrows" your stock and then fails to return it (because it costs them too much to replace, or isn't for sale at any price). They simply don't have as much assets as they owe, and they go bankrupt.

    <text>When you trade options, market makers generally hedge their bets... 

For instance, you buy call options for GME from a market maker, for some price above where it is now.  They estimate the likelihood the price going up and you exercising that option, then buy some percentage of GME stock to have on hand.  Which pushes the price up.  Normally not that significant, but when stocks go bonkers, significant.

ALSO, if you short a stock, the risk is infinite, right?  The price could shoot through the roof, and you could lose far more than the amount you gained for shorting the stock.  So one tactic short sellers use to limit downside is to short a stock, then buy a call option at a higher-than-current price.  That way if the stock price shoots toward infinity, they can use their call option to buy back the shares at less-than-infinity and cover their short position.  Those call options cause market makers to buy some amount of the stock just in case, which pushes the price upward.  

When there's not enough of a stock to go around (like now), this crap significantly affects stock prices.</text>

How is that possible? Where do these stocks you can buy now come from?

    <text>The hedge funders were shorting Gamestop 140-160%. Essentially, they were betting Gamestop would go bankrupt and then some. Keeping the stock price from dropping to nothing keeps them from getting delisted, but it also bring attention to the company, thus potential future business is also generated. And when you short a company, you have a window in which you have to pay those borrowed shares back. A window which WSB is all too happy to wait out. The hedge funds can't hold out forever.</text>

    <text>Hedge funds are just investors.  They often take risky positions that could fail miserably which is why the govt only allows people with high net worth to invest in them—they don’t want regular Joes (or risk-averse investors like pension funds) to lose their shirts!

Yes, they contribute to society by:

(1) investing in risky startups/businesses that aren’t appropriate for most investors

(2) providing liquidity to the market (make it easier for you to buy in, or sell stocks to buy a home or whatever).  Markets function better when there are lots of buyers and sellers

(3) pricing information.  People underrate this aspect of markets but it’s *enormously* important.  Questions like “how much of this should go to buildings, and how much should go to cars, or planes?”  These are impossible to answer without market prices, so getting accurate prices is good.  Otherwise resources get woefully mis-allocated.</text>

    <text>basically , shorting is like gambling so if stock A price is $100 you’re betting that this stock will drop down in value so the new price will be lower ,  so you will be “loaned” or “lended” a stock of that same value of $100 , you INSTANTLY sell it to have $100 now in your pockets BUT you still have to pay back that loan , so if you bet correctly , the price will go down to let’s say $70 , you then buy the stock back for $70 and u pocketed $30 in profit for yours to keep forever to reinvest or do whatever .</text>

    <text>&gt;	Why are hedge funds allowed to exist? 

Freedom of speech, freedom of association, etc.

&gt;Do they contribute to society or the health of financial markets in any way? Or are they just a way for rich people to gamble with large sums of money.

Typically hedge funds have strategies beyond long-equity only that do not correlate with long equity only. So, if your large position in stock goes down, their funds should not necessarily go down as well.  This hedges the rest of the wealth that fund holders have.

One of those strategies is shorting. This keeps companies with public equity in line with their real values, and should in theory limit volatility. In this case, that obviously did not work out. The shorting of GME was a crowded trade, with more stocks borrowed and sold than there exists, by a lot.</text>

    <text>A delta/gamma squeeze is when people buy same week expiration options which forces the seller to buy or sell stock to hedge against the position they sold. A delta is calculated from -1to 1 with 1 delta meaning you will gain a dollar for every dollar it gains(per sharex100). The -1 is if you’re buying a put. Generally speaking a outside the money option will have less than .60 delta.        

Gamma is related to delta in the way it increases delta. The higher the gamma, the higher the delta. Gamma also shows how many shares the option writer has to buy in order to stay hedged against the option they sold. A .69 gamma means they have to buy 69 stock to stay hedged.</text>

    <text>When executed properly, yes. 

The “fundamentals” of a Hedge Fund were originally to HEDGE your bets (diversification) to DECREASE risk. 


The true purpose is so if entire INDUSTRIES (also called sectors) go out of business, not all of someone’s money is lost that is invested in that sector. 


The reason for recent events is because they were so heavily invested on a single COMPANY that they borrowed more shares than even exist, meaning they actually INCREASED risk, causing anyone whose invested in the hedge fund to LOSE even though the stock went up. 


When done correctly they are a good thing, when done like this they cause the impending shit show.</text>

    <text>It doesn’t help GameStop at the moment but the company could issue new shares at these elevated prices as a very cheap source of capital. So instead of the retail traders selling to the hedge funds and making money GameStop themselves could start doing it too. They get cheap money and help the hedge funds unwind their shorts. Also short portions don’t expire but you do have to pay interest on them. A short is essentially borrowing shares and you owe the person you borrowed from short interest. The cost to maintain these short positions have gotten extremely costly and now the hedge funds would rather sell at an loss in most cases than try to ride it out and also pay interest which could just as costly anyways</text>

    <text>Diversifying your portfolio provides a lot of extra security around your money. Investing in many different industries and sectors can be wonderful at minimizing your overall risk.

This also requires loads of time investing and extensively researching. For an individual, sometimes it’s just not feasible to diversify as widely as desired. 

Hedge funds are like a company that steps in to provide the service of providing reduced risk for your entire investment for a fraction of the earnings. You invest in them and they take care of the rest and make it their full time job to take everybody’s money (could be billions) and diversify it.

Like most things in life unfortunately, it has pros and cons which can be argued but just because many people who run hedge fund are “rich capitalist assholes” doesn’t mean the idea of hedge funds is inherently bad.</text>

    <text>Heavy shorting creates downward pressure through the direct sale of the stock. This gets more significant the more it’s shorted. It also tarnishes the company’s image and creates the impression of being doomed to fail, further reducing any influx of new investors. Shorting can be a self-fulfilling prophecy. GameStop in particular was being crushed by shorts to the point that shorts had borrowed 140% of the total number of shares available on the market. They borrowed them, sold them, and then borrowed them from the people they sold them to and sold them *again.*</text>

    <text>Because what wall street was doing was shorting the stock to bankruptcy.  Gamestops outlook wasn't great but they are trying to turn it around and made a few smart moves.  Ryan Cohen, push for online sales blah blah.

Would they have gone bankrupt? Maybe.  But wall street *wanted* to bankrupt them.  They tanked the share price so that Gamestop would have a hell of a time raising capital (create more shares and sell them).  Wall Street saw no hope for them and took out a significant short position(see below) to profit off of bankrupting a company.  All gamestop employees terminated thousands of jobs lost so that billion dollar hedge funds can pad their numbers.  

The hedge funds can't really wait because it isn't *just* hype driving this stock.  Shorting is the act of borrowing a share from a broker, sell it on the open market and hope to buy it back for less while keeping the profit.  The key part is, *they have to buy back the stock*. Also, every day that the share is on loan, the borrower pays interest.  So every day their position gets more expensive.  Their options are: 1) bleed from interest on the borrowed stock or 2)close their short position by buying shares to return to the broker.  

GME had more shares shorted than in existence. This was done, likely by hedge fund (HF) 'A' selling a borrowed share to HF 'B' who loans the share to be shorted again. All of these borrowed shares must be covered (purchased).  This means they have to buy more shares of gamestop than shares exist of gamestop.  The hype doesn't die because everyone holding knows at some point or another, you need to close your positions.

    <text>As I’ve been researching for the past 4 hours (to figure out WTF is going on), I feel like I’m becoming a expert on GameStop. It looks like they are doing relatively fine. Everything on GameStop’s end looks pretty stable, if you look at the last 7 years. 

It sounds like GameStop was being undervalued in the market. The ones undervaluing it, just saw it as a brick and mortar shop. They assumed everything is going digital (which it is, but it’s not happening immediately). So they figured they could do this short sale stuff and make profit. 

I’m a 4 hour expert, so take it all with a grain of salt, but I don’t think anything will happen with GameStop. 

This was all caused by some people betting that GameStop would go bankrupt and they lost their bet, because GameStop is doing fine. 

I think? We might need an actual expert to weigh in.</text>

    <text>Most likely the lenders are pension funds. They are obligated to invest in a fixed mix of assets, think CALPERS, maybe the world's biggest pension fund. They are heavily regulated and the amount invested is usually enormous, so any position exit (like you said) is very costly to them (think of it like this, if there are only 10 stocks of a ticker in the entire market and you own 6 already, if you want to reduce this to 2, you are basically asking the market to double their holdings, while the biggest holder - you - exit, this will absolutely cause the bid price - price at which the market is willing to buy from you - to drop significantly), we call this trading fees due to crossing the bid-ask spread. Plus pension funds are usually in it for the long haul so this is just a blip to them. Finally, the harder are the stocks to be borrowed, the bigger the interest charged on them, so it kinda evens things out.</text>

    <text>Selling something with the intention to purchase it back later.

If the price goes down in the interim, you pocket the difference as profit.  If the price goes up, you lose money.

Short positions usually also imply you borrow the thing being sold and either promise to give it back at a prescribed date, or pay interest on it during the time you hold onto it (or both).

Short positions profit during a time of decline.</text>

    <text>The stock market is not the economy.  

The term “Market share” has nothing to do with the stock market.  Market share is how much of the actual real-market pie a company produces or controls (e.g. - GameStop has 25% of the video game retail market share, behind Videogame Mart and Game Club, both at 30%). 

You are probably thinking of Market Capitalization, which is the total number of shares of stock multiplied by the stock price, giving you the total value of the company.  

Remember when Hertz went bankrupt early last year and the stock skyrocketed?

The stock market is not the economy.</text>

    <text>Eventually if a company stock drops low enough, then theoretically the market value of the company can be lower than the book value.  So you can buy every share and sell the inventory of the company off.  Imagine a lemonade stand worth $1000 on the market that has $100 of lemonade and $100 in a nice stand.  If the market price drops to $100, I’ll simply buy the entire company for $100 and sell the assets off for $200.

The market price is typically much higher than the book price, because the lemonade stand generates profit and that profit has a value that is reflected in the market price.</text>

For example, let's say you hold Tesla stock and so you hold. Now someone asks if they can short your Tesla stock and will pay you 3% to do it.  

That 3% is just free money to you.</text>

    <text>Very interesting read! I have a question for you about that last paragraph. 

Once a company's owner has sold say 49.9% of his ownership, can he actually sell more stocks to get cash (assuming he wants to keep his 50.1%) ? 

Also, what stops a company from manipulating their own value downward (say by having terrible - but controled - results for a while) , then buying back their own stocks for cheap, getting good results for a while after then selling their stocks back for a profit?</text>

    <text>Gamestop likely now has the financial capital to avoid bankruptcy. If they declare it their stock would likely plummet. 

Gamestop has been given an opportunity to recover if it chooses to reorganize itself to be an e-commerce company or something innovative with its assets. I've heard esport lounge ideas but its ultimately up to the company

Company got money, can become profitable or go dead.

    <text>There's short interest on borrowed stocks, you get money for lending out your stocks, at an interest rate applied to the CURRENT stock price, rather than their expected short price or something.

But mostly? Shorts are just a part of the system, so to allow this to happen, brokerages will lend out your bought shares to enable shorting for people. It's typically built into your agreement that you'll be lending out stocks, but you can also ask them to stop.</text>

    <text>If a stock price is depressed and sustained it could affect tertiary factors like executive compensation and perceptions of the press, public, and creditors.  Those are very bad for going concern, but not directly related to the short itself.

Edit, well, I guess the executive comp is directly related.  It could also make you a target for a takeover by another company buying a controlling portion of your shares.</text>

    <text>Do you know what a balance sheet is ? If yes, skip the next paragraph.

A company has to keep track of everything is owns, and the way things were bought. There are two way to finance something : via a debt, or via capital stock. For instance, if I create a company, put $5,000 in it, and borrow $10,000 to the bank to buy a $15,000, the balance sheet looks like this : car ($15k); capital ($5k), debt ($10k). The two parts (what do I own ? and How did I get that ?) have to be equal. What if, now, the car loses value ? Let's say it's only $13k now. I know have to explain where do those $13k came from. Well, the bank won't eat my loss. I still have to repay $10k to the bank, whatever happens to my car. So the part of the money that "moves" is the capital. So now my balance sheet is "$10k, debt, $3k, capital". The same thing happens when the price of the car goes up : it's the capital, not the debt, that increases.

  
Ok, now, a compagny can go bankrupt for two reasons : first, illiquidity. It's when it cannot pay a bill even though it has the capital to do so ! The capital is "trapped" into some objects that have to be sold to release it. But, even though the bank account is $0 now, the company still owns more than it owes ! Some things have to be sold, though. Usually, this kind of bankrupcy get solved : the creditor can give the company enough time to sell some things and pay the debt back.  
The second one is insolvency. It means that, if the compagny would manage to sell everything it owns, there would still be unpayable debts. Even though the company still had $$$ on a bank account, the fact that there is no more capital is the sign that it's game over. Now, a legal organization takes over, sells everything, and give some of the money back to the investors. That's a hard "stop".

Can a decrease in stock price make a company illiquid ? Well, no. This has nothing to do with the company's bank account, so no.

Can a decrease in stock price make a company insolvent ? YES. If the company owns some of its own shares, a decrease of the prices would shorten the capital. BUT, there are regulations about how many shares of itself a company can own. So, even if it can technically happen, it is unlikely. What happens, though, is that somethings companies (often, banks) own a lot of other company's share. There, a massive decrease in the stock price can lead to insolvency. That's what is happening when a bank goes bankrupt.</text>

    <text>Normal money you get from the bank - physical (can touch it / hold in your hand) or digital (in your account); backed by a central bank (i.e. fed reserve) so fairly stable; middle man processing digital transactions (i.e. credit card company)

Cryptocurrency - digital only; not backed by any country or central bank (so less stable); there's settlement processes for transactions but they can be faster and much cheaper than normal money transactions

Like normal money, c.c. derives its value from supply &amp; demand. More ppl want it, price goes up; more of it that exists, price goes down. What makes "more ppl want it" vs "less ppl want it", or "more of it exists" vs "less of it exists" is a fairly complicated question to answer and a bit beyond ELI5.</text>

    <text>Greed and stubborness. You have to realize big firms like Melvin Capital analyze companies from bottom-up meaning they basically look at the fundamentals of how a Company operates. They analyzed Gamestop and decided that they were worth way less than $10 or however much they shorted at. 

When the price of GME rose to $30, the fundamentals didn't change so they still believed GME was still worth shorting. The higher the price of the stock, the more value they got from shorting, so in their point of view, not only was this free money but they were getting WAY more free money than they anticipated so they probably continued to double down on their short anticipating GME to go down.

Only now we know that the price of GME never went down and it spiraled out of control. Now Melvin saw themselves down billions and here we are.</text>

    <text>The purpose of exchanges is to match up buyers and sellers.  So it's not immediate -- they find some other person who has issued a buy order where the terms are acceptable to both parties, then execute the trade.

If there is nobody buying, you won't get matched up with anybody and there won't be any sale.

You can specify in your buy and sell orders things like a limit -- buy 100 shares but don't pay more than N per share, etc.</text>

    <text>They’re reported for all to see, and every hedge fund on the street knew how short Melvin was on GameStop. The reason they didn’t squeeze them is because it would be market manipulation to do so. 

Edit: it wasn’t a bunch of Redditors that figured out this deep secret. It was very much out in the open; the fact that HFs didn’t jump all over this is a pretty strong sign that trying to force a squeeze is a grey area in terms of market manipulation</text>

    <text>My understanding is that it creates a more efficient stock market. If smart people are incentivized to search for companies that are overvalued, then it's more likely to cause the stock price to be correctly priced resulting in a stock price that's more accurate.  

Otherwise, without short selling, volatile stocks become even more volatile.  If losses worsen then this can wipe out investors and make them less likely to invest again. Which means less capital for the entire market, which is bad for the economy.

That's the theory at least.</text>

    <text>ill try to explain but im fairly noobish as well.   


shorting is to a large degree a bullshit speculative mechanic that can be used to massively manipulate markets and destroy smaller stocks.   


Shorting means you sell a contract at a certain price to a person, without actually owning it.   


you do this in the expectation that a stock will fall.  I.e you sell the short contract when a stock is at 300, 

&amp;#x200B;

now your bet goes well and the stock actually falls to 200, at some point you are forced to buy the contract you sold basically. If the stock is 300 when you sold, and is now 200 when you have to buy, you have a netgain of 100.  you gain money when the stock falls. 

&amp;#x200B;

selling something you dont have is bullshit. If done in a coordinated way (as seen in gme yesteray) this can massively drive down the price of a stock, and hereby making owner panic and sell. Even if no real shares were sold the stock will fall down a lot. This means knce you have a certain defree of capital to throw around you can bash around smaller businesses and profit from people being scared and selling.   


&amp;#x200B;

what happened in gme is an extreme amount of shorting( more them real shares of the company actually exist), instead of down the stock went up however.  People realizing these shorters will be forced to buy stock soon (shorts have expirations dates basically ) jumped on the rocket forced by market obligations to rise.   


now shareholder have the capacity to set the stockprice as high as they want and shorters are forced to buy at whatever they are offered.  there really is no potential price limit that could be achieved. Of course if most people sell at 1000 the market price will be 1000. And from there it will only go higher and higher.</text>

    <text>No, you put a sell order, and someone has to buy it. If you put it at market price. Then it'll trigger at the price at posting. If no one buys it, you don't get any money.</text>

    <text>I'd appreciate if someone could ELI5 what determines the number of shares a company has.

Say you have a $100,000 company. That could be divided into 10 shares worth $10,000 each, or 100 shares worth $1000 each, or into 100,000 shares worth $1 each, or even 2 shares worth $50,000 each.

Who determines that division, and how?</text>

    <text>You bet a stock price will go down soon. You borrow a stock from a lender, sell it instantly, wait for it to fall down, buy the same amount of stocks for cheap, and return these stocks to the lender, pocketing the difference - interest (borrowing isn’t free). So if the price increases instead of decreases, you lost the best and have to buy back the stocks at a loss. And the loss is infinite, a stock price can keep going up and up.</text>

    <text>lots of very interesting but long answered questions. Ill try

a)it depends on the company’s IPO goals and share agreements. When a company goes public it almost always does so because it wants to raise capital for a venture or expansion. (yes, initial investors get super ultra rich this way so there is always an ulterior incentive to go public even if it doesn’t make sense but thats another topic) the deal is put together by bankers and stock exchanges they decide whats a good selling price. The selling price determines how many stocks get made because the value of the company has to be divided just enough to reach that price. 

b) Yes you can see which number for every stock. Just divide the market cap by the stock current price

c) it can always be changed but it will affect the value of the outstanding shares. This is done by splitting or reverse splitting the stock. if a stock is worth for 200 dls it can be split 1-2 for example and that creates two stocks with a value of 100 each. The company can also always sell more shares or buy back shares but that doesn’t create more shares, that just modifies the number of outstanding shares in the open market.

d) it depends, usually no. Because for a company to grow large enough to launch an IPO it needs to have raised capital before. This means it probably already sold some equity to initial investors or institutions. All investors own the stock in accordance to whatever deal they made between them. when an IPO happens they decide how much % of the company they are willing to sell to the general public.</text>

    <text>Yes, more or less. These days with computers and the internet everything happens super fast. That's what exchanges are for. Think of an exchange as a list of people buying and selling stock. When you press sell, you put your name on a menu. And in the exchange someone sees your name and price and they say "yes I'll take it" and it's sold. And the price is decided by (SUPER simplified, there are other factors too) what everyone else is buying and selling for.</text>

    <text>Depends on the company. Yes you can see this number when you examine a stocks detail. 

[https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GME](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GME)

Shs outstand is the abbreviation so 65.20 million for GME

The company can issue more shares but it will likely devalue the existing stocks so its avoided. 

The stocks will initially be offered by a bank(usually) but there will be investors that have already invested in the company that will get a certain percentage of the stocks that are issued to the public.</text>

    <text>Imagine you think apples are going to get cheaper, and your friend has 10 apples. You give them a dollar to borrow their 10 apples, and you sell all the apples for a dollar each. This means you have 9 dollars.

Now, you wait until the price of apples goes down. If the price does go down and you buy the apples back for 50 cents each, you can give the apples back to your friend and have 4 dollars left over! If the price goes up, you'll have to pay more than you bought the apples for, and you also paid a dollar to borrow the apples, so you lose money!

So, to answer your question, the money comes from the price of the apples they borrowed and sold going down, only if they are able to buy them back later for a lower price.

The problem here is shorting with so much leverage, that investment funds "sold" more apples than exist in the whole world!</text>

    <text>Great question. This is called counterparty risk and is a huge problem for Brokers, and factored into why Robinhood and IBKR halted trading in certain stocks and derivatives - increasing risk that one of their clients is going to blow up. It's the job of the Broker to make sure that doesn't happen, forcing the short seller, if necessary, to unwind their position as it gets worse.

If your counterparty goes bankrupt, you are out of the money they owed you. If your shares were lent out by an intermediary (a Broker), the Broker is responsible for the cost of returning them to you. A lot of firms were on the verge of going bankrupt in the 2008 mortgage crisis, since everyone was losing money at the same time as derivatives became worthless. This was a major factor in the bailouts that happened around that time. Your last question was, "What happens to the market?" Answer: It's not pretty.

Melvin Capital recently had to be bailed out by Citadel because their short position in GME blew up.</text>

    <text>The “other side” is the person who buys the stock from the short seller.  That person thinks the stock is going up from that point, the short seller thinks it’s going down. So, they win when they sell it to you at $100, it goes down to $10, and you decide you’ve seen enough losses and sell it back.</text>

    <text>It's a deal between an owner of a stock and another individual. Let's say you and me. You own a stock, one stock of Tesla, thus a miniscule part of that corporation. I have a hunch Tesla is going down in value, and I think it's going to happen before next Friday. I wanna make money of my hunch.

We agree that I borrow your one stock until next Friday. Next Friday you buy it back. We agree on you buying it back at today's cost. I borrow it, but you still own it. We make a deal regarding our borrowing on some kind of paper sign by both. If the stock falls in value you still have to buy it back, but at today's price. If the stock rise in value, you still pay it back at today's value. I get to keep or have to pay the difference.

Say a Tesla stock is worth 100 dollars now. Next Friday 80 dollars. Since I borrowed it at 100 dollars and you bought it back at 80 dollars you owe me 20 dollars. If it rises to 120 dollars, I owwe you 20 dollars.

It's a bet between you and me about the value of your Tesla stock in a week.</text>

    <text>At this point with share prices so high, it is more likely that you will lose money than you will make money (speculation, but there’s logic to it). The stock is so volatile that one second you may be in the green, the next in the red. And now we’ve seen Wall Street will limit one’s ability to buy, they may do the same with sells. 

In summary, it’s risky. Could pay off, could lose it all. You have to decide what you’re willing to risk and go from there. There’s probably more value in sticking it to the man by buying GameStop (GME) than there is in potential gains at this point!</text>

    <text>Normally you buy stock, then sell it at a later date.  This is "long" -- You're hoping the price goes up.

You can essentially borrow stocks, sell them, then buy them back to return to the lender at a later date.  This is "short" -- you're hoping the price goes down.  

This has a bunch of implications... 

1. In a long trade, the most you can lose is the money you spent (i.e. the company folds).  But your gains could be infinite (i.e. the stock price goes through the roof).  In a short trade, the most you can gain is 100% (i.e. the company folds).  The most you can lose is infinite (i.e. the company's stock price goes through the roof).  There are ways to mitigate that infinite downside risk with short selling, but it'll cost money to do so.

2. You're BORROWING stock.  You get charged interest, just like on a loan.

3.  The entity you borrowed the stock from may demand you liquidate your portfolio to buy back the stock to return to them.

Another thing that's getting thrown around a lot right now is "naked shorting".  This would be selling shares you don't own without borrowing them first.  It's illegal, but still happens via loopholes and other shady pracices.</text>

    <text>No, you just own one piece of the company but aren’t held accountable for their actions. For instance, if they get in a lawsuit and lose, they cannot go after the shareholders individual money- the shareholder is protected. There benefit from you buying a share is the fact of supply and demand: if a company is doing well enough to attract people who want to buy into the company, that increase in demand increases share price. This increased share price increases the value of the company which allows them to use more money to buy things to expand or help their business.</text>

    <text>Not really. At the end of the day the debtor still owes the debt. If it's tradable, it would be a bond. Could they blow up those who own the bonds? Probably not. But the debt would still exist even if they could. Not paying the debt is the best way for the bond holders to not get paid. But that is priced in. And there may be instruments that act as insurance against non payments.</text>

    <text>For the exact same reason that borrowing money to buy a house is legal.
 When you sell short, you are not inventing a stock share out of thin air. At least in theory, you are actually borrowing the shares that you are selling from your own brokerage. You are simply promising to pay them back tgose shares at some future time, whenever you want.</text>

    <text>It won’t hurt the end goal but you should be aware of the mechanics of a short squeeze.  Basically what is likely to happen if it is not derailed by big money, is a short squeeze will start which means that all of the hedge funds are closing their positions at whatever price the market is demanding. During this window the stock could shoot way up (no one can accurately predict how high it will go, but given how heavily shorted the stock is, it is likely to be very high).  After the squeeze is over the price of the stock will drop almost dead, probably back down to its “fundamental” value of somewhere between $15-$40.  People who do not sell in time are going to get burnt really bad in all of this.  Many people do not like to admit this part because the current goal is just to lure new traders and get them to hold for the squeeze.  This will end badly for some people and others may never have to work another day in their life

    <text>Another way to think about it is that someone borrowed a stock that was already borrowed from someone else. That's not how it actually works, but it puts it into a linear perspective. If two or more people with a lending agreement are participating in the same trade, then a single stock can wind up being sold *and* borrowed *at the same time,* creating the illusion that there are more of them than there really are.

Since we're talking about a game company, let's use a relevant thought experiment.

Suppose there are two game stores in town. The next-gen console is about to be released onto the market. One store sells 60 preorders for the latest console. The other store sells 50 preorders. However, at launch, each store receives 50 units of the console.

Of course, in a retail environment, the solution is simple: the first store just needs to refund the cost of the preorder to the 10 customers it can't furnish a console to. In stocks, it doesn't work that way. You owe your lender a *console*, not a cash refund.

So the first store now has to find 10 consoles, and there is only one type of person who has them: the scalpers reselling them at well above retail value.</text>

Once you lend a stock, the other party sells it and it can be immediate lent by someone else to short again. There's no restriction on a single share being lent more than once. Not sure what naked short selling is so I won't comment there</text>

    <text>Thats exactly right. Hedge funds are selling borrowed shares to others who turn around and sell those. Extremely illegal. So now they owe more shares than even exist. They are in such deep water even that they CONTINUE to short the stock in massive amounts all at once to drive down the price. This morning i lost 60k (in the time it took the dental hygienist to clean my teeth) due to them halting buying of certain stocks (illegal) ladder selling and shorting. Honestly i cant even explain all of the convoluted shit thats happening, but they use naked shorting and other tactics to drive down the price. But as you can see by the ammount of hell its raised, they are not winning lol.</text>

    <text>Margin calculations are somewhat complex, but effectively you can only borrow up to half your account value, at current prices, so if you have a million dollar account, you can borrow up to another million, and if your position moves against you, once you hit the limit, you have need to contribute new cash to top it up, or the broker closes your position at the then current price, and you lose essentially everything in the account.</text>

    <text>You can sign up for extended hour trading on Fidelity and likely other sites as well (don’t need to be anyone special). 

It works the same as regular trading, but there are fewer buyers and sellers, so it’s better to go with limit orders, which widen the price window over which the trade can execute. 

It’s convenient to have extended hours trading if you work a 9-5, etc.</text>

    <text>They almost certainly did that today with the massive drop. It was a very low volume drop (since very few buy orders were allowed), meaning it was only a few very large sell orders that sent the stock tumbling, and those large sell orders were likely short sells by the hedge funds who are in trouble.

It's possible they covered these positions already by buying back the shares, as it rose up very quickly after, but none of that data has to be disclosed, so we don't know for sure (which is bullshit).</text>

    <text>A short position works by "borrowing" a stock from broker A and immediately selling it at market value to broker B. Then "promising" to pay back broker A the stock at hopefully a much lower value in the future, pocketing the difference in decline in value. 

Broker B doesn't know that the stock you gave him was borrowed from Broker A. Broker B stock can the be lent out again to another short seller. Therefore the same stock can be lent out multiple times.

So the amount of short positions in GME exceeded the amount of shares floating in the stock market for GME by 140%.</text>

    <text>Some investors are continuing to short, but it's risky, as the market can remain irrational indefinitely, while they have finite supplies of money to lose.  

Unlike with other stock trading, shorting can expose you to unlimited risk, as you \*must\* pony up stock when your time's up, and thus can be out whatever the price of the stock is... even if it's 200 times what you paid for it.</text>

    <text>&gt;What happen if you buy stock after the market is close?

Depends on what the option you set to buy at. Market orders that are not filled by the end of trading hours will automatically be cancelled. There are other options of course where, for example, you can set the price which you want to buy at (along with how long you want to wait for it hit that price).

&gt;but if the stock closed at $10? Will it be at $10 in the morning?

Nope. There is a period before (pre-market) and after (after hours) when the stock market is closed for the majority of retail investors/traders. I believe mostly only larger institutional firms trade outside of market hours but [some brokerages have allowed it too](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/after-hours-trading-am-i-able-to-trade-at-this-time/) (Fidelity, Charles Schwab, TDA).</text>

    <text>In the short term, no. In fact, while a lot of people have been coming up with insane conspiracy theories about why a lot of brokerage firms halted trading in GME, the likely reasons why it was done were to prevent this from creating capital issues for some market makers, and to limit the risk that some small retail investors would be completely burnt. 

I know a lot of people are upset at their brokerage for closing their positions at $100 but like, they returned 1000% in a couple days, they should just shut up and take their money. 

As for longer term consequences, I really hope that this does not result in any crazy amount of legislation. In the end, the system worked as intended: a bunch of small time gamblers made some money bullying some large institutional investors, and the casino was shut down after most people had had a good time but before someone could get seriously, brutally hurt. In a vacuum, I know a lot of people would have liked the meme’ing to continue, but it would have been very scary if this had turned into some kind of systemic issue, or if a lot of people found themselves trying to catch falling knives.</text>

    <text>Everyone is saying no, and that's mostly correct, but there have been some ripple effects. In order to cover their shorts, several of the hedge funds had to sell off other assets such as Amazon and Apple stock. This caused several of those healthy stocks to drop a little, which is a loss of value in the short term. However, those values will likely go back up over time and normalize once the current volatility settles. So long term investors, 401ks. Pensions, etc should be fine but may see some dips for a few weeks before returning to normal.</text>

    <text>This was posted in another thread: 
I’m just going to paste the answer I’ve been giving:

Short selling involves borrowing a stock from someone who owns it with the promise to return it at a later date, and pay a small fee based on the value of the stock. You then sell the stock, wait for the price to drop and buy it back at a cheaper price. You then return the stock to the original owner and pocket the difference.

This allows people to make money off of a drop in the price of a stock. Unlike with regular stock trading, however, the potential losses of you are wrong are not limited. If you buy a $10 share in a company and the company goes bankrupt, you lose $10. If you short a company with a $10 share price, and that price jumps to $100 per share, you just lost $90.

Since the start of the pandemic, GameStop has clearly been struggling in a big way. Such a big way, that a lot of people, including major hedge funds, decided to short GameStop. A lot.

Let’s say I own a share of GameStop stock and you want to short it. I lend you my share, and you sell it. Now someone else wants to short the stock as well, so they borrow the share from the person you sold it to and then they sell it. And so on. If this happens enough times, you can have more people who owe back a share to the “original” owner than there are actual shares of the stock.

This happened to GameStop which had 140% of its share sold short. This presents a problem for short sellers if the price of the stock starts going up instead of down, because there aren’t enough shares to go around if they decide they all need to cut their losses and buy back the shares they owe at once.

Some smaller investors, including those at r/wallstreetbets, noticed this happening to GameStop’s stock and decided to take advantage. They bought up a bunch of shares themselves, driving the price up and further limiting the availability of shares. This caused some short sellers to pull out, which drove the price up further, which caused more short sellers to pull out, and so on.

Meanwhile, the attention brought to this story and the quickly rising share price caused more people to buy the stock in the hope of taking advantage of the meteoric rise in price to make money themselves.

Back in the summer, you could buy a share for $4 apiece. Yesterday, those same shares were $147 each. Today they’re $345. The big hedge funds that were selling the stock short are currently literally billions in the hole while the smaller investors are making money hand over fist.

That all said, GameStop is still a struggling company underneath it all. It is nowhere near as valuable as its current share price, which means that, eventually, the bubble is going to burst and the price is going to come crashing back down. Anyone who buys in at the top expecting it to keep shooting up is going to lose a ton of money. Anyone still shorting it at that time is going to make a ton of money, and anyone who bought it early and sells before it pops is going to make a ton of money.

It’s not entirely clear whether the hedge funds are going to wind up actually losing billions in the end or if they can recoup some of that when the bubble bursts (they may or may not come out ok), but there are definitely going to be a bunch of people currently riding the hype train who lose whatever they invest at this point.</text>

    <text>Snake borrows banana from monkey, and sells it to antelope. Snake owes monkey a banana.

Antelope sells the banana to cheetah. Now cheetah has the banana. Snake then borrows the banana from cheetah, and sells it to hippo. Snake now owes monkey *and* cheetah a banana, even though there's only one banana going around.

This is not supposed to happen, but it does. Since any given stock is the same as any other, there's no checks in place to track how each of them move around.

Edit: "naked short selling", in this example, refers to the snake having no guarantee that he can actually pay back those two bananas he owes. He could have made a contract with someone else that he could buy 2 bananas from them at a set price if necessary; then he would have been covered. But that's not possible here, because *there is only one banana*. Also such a contract costs money, and snake is greedy.</text>

    <text>Actually, potentially. I’ve seen some articles stating that some indexes are adding GME. Most 401ks are based on indexes. So if the company that manages your 401k decides to buy into GME, or short it, it could affect the average person. 

I don’t know if any of this is happening. Just a speculation on one way it could affect you.

Edit: by “articles” I of course mean Reddit comments.</text>

    <text>If my understanding is correct, they Technically haven't lost the money yet because they don't have to buy back the shares yet. Once it comes around for them to buy them back to cover their loses, the price is going to shoot up so much that you'll need a telescope to see the top.

What is really passing people off is that the hedge funds are so powerful that they are starting to change the rules of the stock market on the fly. Imagine youre in a game of chess and youre beating a grand Master, then he starts making up rules.</text>

    <text>They could be selling stocks to legitimate buyers, or more likely, to other people who were shorting GME. All a short position is is a bet that a stock will fall in price, as long as the stock price continues to fall, there is potential profit to be made. The limit of this is when the stock price reaches $0.</text>

    <text>How does after-hours trading work? I mean, I see the price (I'm watching GME like everyone else) changing, but if the price can change them what's the point of declaring the market closed? 

If you really aren't buying and selling during the night, and instead are promising to buy and sell later, how does that work with a volitile price like this one? If I try to buy a share right now at say $300, do I actually own a share or does it only "happen" when the market opens? And if so, how do price changes between my purchase and the market opening get recognized?

It's all too confusing for my tiny brain.</text>

    <text>Almost definitely not. There is a teensy minuscule chance that enough of WSB owns enough stock that they can effectively extort these hedge funds for more than they are worth, thereby bankrupting the hedge fund. At that point, I believe that the broker for the initial short bet is on the hook to cover the remainder of the cost of the bet, which may have some collateral impact. If that actually happens, there's an even teensier chance that WSB can extort the broker into insolvency, which would have the broker's bank be on the hook for the remaining cost, which would have further effects on the economy as at that point reddit would be shaking down a bank. Granted, this is all what would theoretically happen if the hive mind of WSB can maintain the level of stock they're holding and jack up the price effectively ad infinitum.</text>

    <text>That's not completely true. They have the right to sell up to 100 million dollars worth in new stock. Not just a split. This would create new stocks and dilute the value of the other stocks.  At 100 dollars a share that's a million new shares.</text>

    <text>So a person can borrow a stock. If a stock is $10 they spend $10 to borrow it. They then immediately sell it onto some for $10 and get their money back. However, they still owe $10 for the stock they borrowed. They wait for the stock to decrease in value to say $7 and sell it back to the person they borrowed it from for $7. They get to keep the $3 difference. 
This becomes an issue if instead of the stock decreasing in value, it increases. So if after they borrow it at $10 and it increases to $12, they will have to sell it back at $12 and they lose $2 overall.</text>

    <text>Basically short selling is “borrowing” a stock and selling it immediately to someone else. Of the stock was 100 dollars then you have 100 dollars. Then they have an expiration date before they have to “buy back in” and that’s when they pay for the stock they sold but they are hoping to stock is cheaper than 100 dollars in order to make money. Basically betting the stock is going to drop</text>

    <text>At 1 of 2 points, whenever comes first:  
A) When the group that lent them the stocks wants them back B) Whenever the Hedgefunds get the prices their looking for.

To call it a "bet" is true, but overly simplified. A short is when you borrow a stock, sell it at a high price, then buy it back at a low price. Then, give that now low stock back to the original owner.</text>

    <text>Ok. let's say there's a company, and their shares are selling for $10 each.

Let's also say that you've done some analysis and you're pretty damned sure the price of that stock is going to go down.

So, you go to a broker and ask to borrow 1 share for a little while. **The agreement being that you return 1 share of that stock later.**

As soon as you get it, you sell it. Now you have $10.

Now let's say you were right and the price of those shares drops to $1.

You buy 1 share for a total of $1 and give it back to the broker. 

You just made $9.

Now in reality, your take is going to be less than that. For instance you have to pay the broker in the first place and such. But if the price drops low enough, you'll still make money.</text>

    <text>It's more like this: the short-seller borrows a share valued at say, $10. They sell that share, for $10. The share price later goes down, to $9. The short-seller can then buy a share at the lower price, and end up pocketing the difference, $1. But, if the price goes up, the short-seller still owes the share-lender one share, and will lose their $10+however much the price went up. Of course, this omits a small fee the share-lender charges (generally a flat amount agreed upon up-front, far less than what the short-seller stands to make in profit) &amp; must be paid, regardless of whether the short seller makes or loses money.

This week's drama is a bunch of short-sellers (in hedge funds) getting caught having to buy back the stocks at a loss because the price went up, and the price went up because of a social media-driven run on GME and other stocks. It is unusual, so there will be investigations, mostly of the regulated firms &amp; hedge funds that have to report on their behavior, and probably not the private citizens who ultimately do their trading through regulated intermediaries like Robinhood. Robinhood might be investigated, but its users, probably not.</text>

    <text>The key is you’re selling something you don’t own. You have to borrow it from someone else to sell it, and so you must also give it back to them later by buying it. 

If the stock does go down, then you profit because you sold high and bought low. If the stock goes up you could potentially lose unlimited money, because there’s no limit to how high the stock price could be when you’re forced to buy it back.</text>

    <text>game stop was shorted more than 140%. This means 140% of the current shares of gamestop on the market were betting that the stock would go DOWN. When regular people buy the stock it makes the price go up some and the person holding the short position starts losing money. How do they get out of their short position? they have to buy the stock and close their position so they don’t lose any more money by the stock going up. What happened is there isn’t enough shares for them to buy because they shorted it 140%. which means the price for these shares keeps going up because they are trying to close these positions but it only drives the prices higher

    <text>Short squeezes in a nutshell:

Imagine you want to make some quick money. Your dad is on vacation for a few months and you decide to sell his stash of gold for $1,000,000. You have a hunch that the price of gold will be going down, so you can just buy the same amount of gold for $800,000 later and pocket the rest.

But instead of the price of gold going down, it goes up- way up. Before you know it, you're forced to sell many of your belongings just to buy back the gold for $1,200,000. You can't bear the risk to wait any longer- if the price continues to go up you could lose your house! And you *have* to buy it back at some point.

This is pretty much a short squeeze. Just rather than "borrowing" gold from your father, you borrow stocks for stockholders. And as the price goes up, you eventually are forced to buy at an inflated price or else risk losing everything.</text>

    <text>I think because it was easy. This hedge fund was particularly greedy and had sold more Gamestop shares than were technically available with the plan to buy them back at lower value. A certain Redditor noticed and brought attention to it on Wallstreetbets, so everyone rallied behind it.</text>

    <text>Their outstanding positions do not expire, gain interest, and the price seems to keep getting steeper for them.  

If they start buying back in, it will take more than a day for it to happen and the price will be jacked.

That time frame might be off, but thats the key to the whole thing.</text>

    <text>Because it is serendipity that happens once in a lifetime. 

Gamestop stock:

* Has a low number of shares

* Had over 140% short interest

* Had huge options buying because it was simply a favorite of a hardcore fan base..

All it took was some shred of good news to set off the powder keg. That happened once news broke that GME was getting a management overhaul.  All of the sudden options exploded in value which caused the writers of the contracts to have to go out and buy a huge numbers of shares to live up to their obligation of the options contracts (gamma squeeze).  The huge number of shorts also feel extreme pressure to stop their bleeding, so they have to buy shares (short squeeze).  Because the pie for the number of shares is very small and you have a huge number of short sales and options contract writers all fighting over shares, price is exploding.  But if average joes start piling in and buying shares and holding them, the price goes up much higher and faster because the pie of shares available gets even smaller for the shorts and options writers to buy, meaning they'll have to pay more.  


Complete serendipity. A once in lifetime event  really. GME was the perfect stock because it has a small number of shares.  It will be hard to pull this off again, if ever. GME is just perfect.</text>

    <text>The easy answer is that the stock is “borrowed” from investors that own it. E.g. if you own GME stock on Etrade, and another trader on Etrade shorts GME. Etrade can lend your shares to the trader that shorts. Do you know that your shares have been lent out? Probably not. 

The trader who shorts also pays Etrade “interest” to borrow the shares. It’s up to Etrade whether they want to disclose to you that they have lent out your shares and will give you a cut of the interest. 

How can this be you ask? When you buy a stock on your brokerage account. The broker assigns ownership of the stock to you. But the actual owner of the stock thats recorded with the Depository Trust Commission (DTC) is the broker (Etrade). So Etrade can essentially do what they want with your stock since they technically own it. Only your contractual terms and agreement with Etrade gives you ownership rights. 

Problems arise when these broker-dealers lend out shares that they do not have in their accounts. So let’s say Etrade customers hold a total of 100 GME shares, but traders on the platform want to short 120 GME shares. If Etrade lends out 120 GME shares, without securing 20 additional shares first. This is called Naked Short selling from a regulatory standpoint and it is illegal. This practice was rampant for most of the stock market’s history and banned by the SEC in 2008. However, don’t be surprised if this still happens. This is the reason why many crypto ppl are advocating for blockchain and digitizing the stock market. So shares can be issued directly to individuals, and there is a public ledger of account that tells you exactly how many shares exist, and WHERE they exist so that you can’t materialize shares out of thin air to lend out to shortsellers.</text>

    <text>Sorta but definitely on a lesser extent. Personally, I believe that GME could go upwards of 5,000, just depends on if people hold and how these next few weeks go. If people keep buying and holding and don’t sell it could skyrocket. 

Everyone else will be lucky to get to 500 imo. Im not a financial advisor, just some random idiot with an opinion. But I did purchase some AMC stock because why the hell not lol. If they don’t skyrocket then they’ll still be good to hold until Q3 when people surge back to the theater for the first time</text>

    <text>So it's not this one hedge fund in particular, but hedge funds in general. Many investors still remember 2008, where hedge funds and other large investors created a huge artificial housing bubble that exploded, and many executives made out like bandits and these banks and hedge funds were bailed out while  nobody was held responsible for what happened which led to the greatest economic dip since the Great Depression.

In this scenario, people noticed these hedge funds had an ridiculous amount of shorted stock and realized that an uptick in stock value could result in a short squeeze, costing them billions while individual investors could make thousands of not millions.</text>

    <text>Mostly you're borrowing the shares from another of your broker's customers. The broker charges you interest on that.

You'll enter into some kind of an agreement with the broker that you'll pay a certain interest per day, how long you expect to be shorted for, and what price that you will be forced to buy back stock if the share price rises.

The owner of the shares don't necessarily know, or care that their shares are being shorted. They are usually longer term investors, and will only care when they want to sell.

Don't ask me how $GME was 140% shorted, that just seems criminal.</text>

    <text>What’s special about GameStop is that it’s a retail driven short squeeze facilitated by social media. 

Short squeezes have definitely happened before and are a common market mechanism to keep shorting under control.

Shorting the market is a useful tool to keep market prices at an efficient level. When we say efficient, we mean that they reflect current market value and aren’t oversold or overbought to a level that the price is artificially pumped up or depressed. However, some hedge funds have been using it to artificially drive down prices systematically. They chose stocks that have little value and are bad companies and were just pounding away at them. Generally, that strategy works as the companies eventually fail. However, for every short position there usually should be a long position. When that gets out of equilibrium, then there’s an opportunity to create a short squeeze. What this means is that someone can come along and start buying up all the stock knowing that at some point, the short sellers are going to have to buy back the stocks. Further, when you are short a stock and the price goes up then you lose money. Unlike owning a stock, when you are short then you need to realise those losses in margin. If the stock price goes up a huge amount then you can lose a lot of money and further to close out that position you have to buy back the stock! Buying back the stock puts further pressure on the price driving it even higher so shorters are between a rock and a hard place ans out a lot of money. Going one step further, if those who hold the stock are working in a concerted effort then they can effectively corner the market and they can effectively name any price for the stock knowing that short sellers have to buy.</text>

    <text>Depends on how the short is done.

Simply shorting the shares generally doesn't have a specific time frame, you just pay interest on your borrowed assets.

Shorting through options is a different story, as options are indeed contracts to buy or sell stocks at specific prices on specific dates.</text>

    <text>When you sign up for a brokerage account there is something called “stock lending program”. Some automatically opt you into this program others let you choose. When you’re part of this program, it essentially gives your broker the ability to lend out your shares to someone who wants to short it, without you knowing. If you manually opt in, they give you a portion of the profit, if you’re automatically opted in, you get a nice pat on the back</text>

    <text>They do make money by lending out the shares. The person selling the shorts pays a premium to be able to sell the other person's shares, and then also gives them back the shares when the short seller has to buy them back. 

Hypothetically, if the price per share is $20, a short seller will pay a shareholder (not 100% how that person is chosen, or if they specifically list their share as available to short sell and set the premium themselves), say, $1 per share that they can sell at $20 per share right now, then, if their speculation is correct, buy shares later at $5 per share, having made $14 profit per share. The person who lent the share to be shorted will have made $1 per share and then also receive back shares worth $5 apiece.

This doesn't seem like a lot, but the hedge funds doing it are shorting billions of dollars worth of shares, so a theoretical $14/share profit is a lot of money. And if you think that the shares will go up, you lend to a short seller hoping that the shares will be worth more when returned to you, on top of the premium you charged the short seller.

To be honest, I am not 100% that's how it works, as it is complicated, but I think I'm pretty close.</text>

    <text>GameStop scenario is the first of its kind. Where the average man has made a stand against hedgefunds.
Never happened before because of the amount of organisation. Wallstreetbets all banded together in one massive group and all did what they said there were gonna, in this case keep buying and nit selling.
It works because wallstreetbets have driven the price up, forcing the hedgefunds to buy back the stock at a higher price to keep their promise to their customer.
People change it because the poor man is winning, and that’s not the plan</text>

    <text>They are borrowing from other investors who owns the stocks. Depending on the contract, sometimes they get paid an interest rate, or an insurance or nothing. If there are no shares to lend, you cannot lend it. Just as if there are no stocks to buy, you cannot buy it. (In which case you could offer more money and perhaps then are someone willing to sell/loan to you - thus the stock price ticks higher).</text>

    <text>There are many ways. The canonical example is called shorting or short selling. Say I think that GameStop is a failing company. I think it’s shares will lose value over the next 3 months. 

I find someone who owns shares of GameStop and say to them, “can I pay you $10 borrow 10 of your shares? I’ll give them back after three months.” We make the exchange. Now I have 10 GameStop shares and -$10.

I sell all of those shares that I’ve borrowed for $10 each, the current market price. Now I have $100-10=$90. $90 in my pocket. Three months has gone by and GameStop is now selling for $6 per share. I buy back those ten shares for $60 total. Now I have $30 and 10 shares of GameStop. I return the shares to the person I’ve borrowed from, and now I have made $30. I’ve made money from the stock falling in price. So what’s the risk? 

What happens if GameStop goes up to $300 per share during those three months? I still have to buy it back. I have to spend $3000 to fulfill my contact meaning I’ve lost $2910 in the process. In theory I could lose an infinite amount. This is why shorting is dangerous and this is the problem that these big funds who bet against GameStop are facing right now.</text>

    <text>(Paraphrasing from a French post on r/Quebec about short sell) : Alice borrows an apple from Charles, she sells the apple to Jack for 5 dollars and will pay Charles later. But the price of apples goes down: they're worth 3 dollars now. So Alice gives back 3 dollars to Charles and made 2 dollars in the transaction. On the contrary, if the price goes up (10 dollars), Alice still needs to pay back Charles but she will lose 5 dollars.</text>

    <text>All values are completely artificial, value isn't a real tangible thing. Its up to an owner to decide how much they like the thing they own and attribute a value to it. Stock market price is kinda the mean value of what everyone think a stock is worth.

Some people think gamestop stocks has a high value because they can sell it even higher in the future, Some people think gamestop stock has value because they like the stock. The more people that see value in the stock, the higher the price goes.

So what makes people think they can sell the stock at a higher price later on?

Basically hedge funds have taken out "payday loans" from the stock, which is exactly what it sounds like, you borrow 10 shares today, and pay back 10 shares at a later time + a quite hefty interest. Now the problem is they have borrowed more shares then they can pay back, so they have to buy stocks from the market to give back to their loan sharks, a even bigger problem is that they borrowed so much that even if they buy all stocks available for trade they still come up short. So the value in the stock for the poor hedge fund manager isn't the prospect of selling it later, its value is to be able to repay a loan to get out of the interest, which makes its value very high for him.

This means its the sellers market, you can name your price for the stock and the hedge fund have to either pay your price, or continue paying the interest, which at $62,000,000 isn't something you want to do for a long time, on their loans and hope they can get the stock cheaper another day, but every day their situation is worse so people are betting that its just a matter of time until they fold.

ELI5 version:

You have $100 but no gum, now your bully at school say you have to give him a gum else he will take your $100, There isn't any 50 cent gum left in the store because your friends bought it all so you go around to all your friends asking to buy a gum but no one wants to sell it to you so you raise and raise the price until someone think its worth selling his gum to you, even though the gum only costed 50 cents at the store, as long as you get the gum for less then $100 you will still get away with some money so for you the gum is worth around $99.</text>

    <text>there are several ways. the one being widely talked about today is short selling. here’s how it works:

If a stock is at $10, i can borrow someone else’s shares, and sell them. Let’s say i borrow 10 shares, and i sell all of them immediately. i will eventually have to return 10 shares to that guy, but now i now have $100. 

i am betting that the stock price will go down. if the stock tanks to $5, i can use my new $ to buy 10 shares, to pay them back to the guy I borrowed from. It will only cost me $50. so the guy gets his shares back, and i just made $50 from the stock going down.

This is oversimplified but yeah</text>

    <text>Imagine your friend has a car and you know it’s in demand but will drop in value a lot next week. So you borrow it from him and sell it to someone else, knowing you’ll buy it back next week after the price drops and give it back to your friend who you borrowed it from. So your friend still ends up with their car in the end but you keep the difference between how much you sold it for (when the market value was high) and how much you bought it back for (when the value was low), essentially making you money when the price dropped. 

However, if you guessed wrong and the value went up? Well now you’re on the hook to get your buddy’s car replaced and pay the difference out of pocket, losing you money!</text>

    <text>There is a significant risk of losing any money put into the stocks that are getting a lot of press now. Also the mechanism by which people were able to drive up the stock price may be exhausted now because there aren't any more short sellers so any gains may no longer be around.

You said that selling pushed down the prices "artificially", but that's always what selling does. There's nothing artificial about that part. Which is what I said.</text>

    <text>Fundamentally, the "value" of any stock is the discounted value of all future cash flows. More easily stated, the more a company will make in the future the more it's worth.

Hedge funds shorting $GME see Gamestop as a brick and mortar store that typically resides in malls. Earnings continue to drop and will continue to drop so the stock will continue to fall.

WSB and some other investors see Gamestop not as mall-centric brick and mortar, but a potential e-commerce powerhouse in the gaming sector, which is really taking off. Essentially what Amazon did for books, they think Gamestop will do for gaming. They think future earnings will be much much higher than they are now.

Who is right? Time will tell, but it's a difference in how they view the company.</text>

Don’t spend money you can’t afford to lose and more importantly, don’t panic sell when the price dips halfway during the day and don’t sell if it doubles in price. Hold the share. That’s the most important part of this.</text>

    <text>All those gains/losses are virtual right now.  I mean, if a WSBer bought 100 GME at 20 a piece, they are right now sitting on 100 GME that are worth 200 a piece, i.e. a virtual profit of 18K USD.  It only becomes a real money profit when they sell.</text>

    <text>In normal circumstances, issuing more stocks makes sense when a company is growing but in this case it would likely dilute the value of the existing stocks.   If there are 1,000,000 stocks out there at $100...issuing another million stocks would likely cause the value of all the stocks to drop to $50.   The only time that this wouldn’t happen is if the stocks were being issued to raise additional capital for the company to reinvent in the business to help it grow...maybe to launch a new website or acquire a business or expand stores.  In that case, the stock price would go up because investors anticipate that additional capital would be used wisely to grow the business.  In GameStop’s case, additional shares and additional capital would be used for....???</text>

    <text>This is a phenomenal explanation. I've seen two other people try to explain it on facebook and I was still very confused because they were talking about margin accounts and brokers without ever clarifying that the short sellers were taking out GME "on loan" and had to pay back GME shares (i.e., I didn't understand why they couldn't just pay back the dollar amount of the stock at the time they borrowed it, but now I get that it doesn't work that way).

The inner workings of Wall Street are *extremely* foreign concepts to average people who don't have any exposure to them.

Really good job explaining.</text>

    <text>Hedge funds shorted stocks in GME (borrowing a stock and hoping it gets lowered so you can buy it back and return it).

Someone noticed, told people and mass buying started, hedge funds now owe the stock to their broker/lender, and the price didn't go down, it went up.

The 'squeeze' comes in when people wont sell and the hedge fund needs more to return or they pay late fees. So yes supply and demand.</text>

Jeez I had not seen any mention of there also being large open positions in the options on GME.  If those same people also sold uncovered calls (which is actually a part of this shit I understand better than L&amp;B) then they are very rightly quaking in their boots.</text>

    <text>Do the investors who have shorted shares have a time frame in which they need to pay back the lender? Why can't they just wait for the shares held by WallStreetBets users to be sold and let the market return to normal before buying back those shares and returning to the lenders so they don't incur such grave losses?</text>

    <text>Short squeeze is a scramble to cover your losing bet that a company will fail. This drives the price up as you scramble to buy whatever you can to get out.

Gamma squeeze is related to options contracts. These contracts control 100 shares of stock each by placing bets that the stock will go up or down. In Gamestop's case, people bet the stock would go up extremely heavily. Behind the scenes, the company that sells you this bet needs to cover their behinds by buying more stock. Since a lot of stock had to be bought, it drove up the price.

In both cases the rapid scramble to purchase stock drives up the price.</text>

    <text>But there's a missing piece here. Who loses the money in a successful short? Is it the other shareholders? What if the other shareholders just don't sell when the stock goes down? Or does not selling by itself prevent the stock from going down on any short? 

Value isn't created when a stock goes down, so the capital has to come from other people. it's a (less than) zero sum game.</text>

    <text>Think about it from an economics standpoint- supply &amp; demand. 
If the supply of GME is the same (it is) and the demand is increasing, then there will be movement along the supply curve, raising the equilibrium price of the stock. 

In simple terms, since there are many people who want to buy the stock and are more willing to pay for it at any price, the sellers of the stock will clearly sell it as high as possible to maximize the money they earn.

It's like price gouging a PS5 on ebay. There are many people who want to buy a PS5, MUCH more than the number of PS5s available. Some would even buy one at a remarkable price. If your an ebay seller, you want to sell PS5s for as much money the consumers are willing to pay for.


Basically, what I'm trying to say is each share you buy will ever so slightly raise the price of the stock. Jus' a tiny lil' bit.</text>

    <text>Yeah, and it really only takes one big event to make people rethink this sort of speculation. You can speculate in a lot of agricultural commodities markets in the USA, _but not onion futurers_.

Why not onions? Because in the 1955 a guy named Vincent Kosuga (also known as the Onion King) bought up 98% of the Onion Futures market (making a fortune, but robbing the country of access to reasonably priced onions), and then dumped all of those onions back onto the market all at once (crashing the price of onions, and making a second fortune because he had also shorted the market).

He got hauled in front of congress over the whole thing, and then the Onion Futures Act got passed to make it illegal to trade onion futures.

Did all the other commodities futures (pork bellies, cattle, corn, wheat, and all the rest) get protected against this sort of market manipulation? Nope. Just onion futures got banned.

There is a really good Planet Money podcast on the whole onion thing if you want a better and more in depth explanation of exactly what happened.</text>

    <text>The stock market is beholden to supply and demand like any other commodity. The more people purchase something, the higher the demand and the greater the price. 

&amp;#x200B;

Initially, it was a smart business move in that they knew:

1. People were making a short (ie, they promised to buy stocks at a future time). 
2. It was a huge short (the numbers I saw were +140% of the actual stocks available at Gamestop)
3. So they attempted to short squeeze them and it's working

&amp;#x200B;

Now people are joining the bandwagon to stick it to billionaires in an Occupy Wall St 2.0.</text>

    <text>If you want to make money from it dropping in value.  Say you are just certain that a share will drop from 15 to 10, buying it at 15 does you no good at all.  What will you do next with this share you bought for 15 that you know will be worth 10 in one week?

You also cannot sell a share you do not have.  The short of the story is still.  I think GME will drop in value so I want to buy low sell high except that high is now and low will be next week.  So you borrow the share just to be able to sell first then buy later.</text>

    <text> This raises so many more questions.

 1. How/why do the shorts have a deadline that the public can discover?
 2. If more than 100% of stock is shorted, why is the stock going down? You can't buy more than 100% of the available stock, right? So doesn't the mere fact of owning GME stock guarantee that you when the shorts expire you will be paid whatever the stock is worth?
 3. Why did expert traders make this massive short considering the potential blow up?
 4. Why did they short it even more when this WSB thing started happening?

 edit: wew, thanks for the replies. Each one illuminates some different aspect. I feel like a total brainlet right now. Gonna have to sleep on this and hope my brain puts it all together overnight.</text>

    <text>So, you borrow a share from someone to establish a "short" or "bearish" position in that stock.  You immediately sell it at the current market price.  Your strategy is now to wait for the value of that stock to fall, and when you are satisfied with the new, lower value at some point in the future, then you buy the share from someone else at the new, lower market price.  Then, you can return the share you owed to the original owner who lent it to you.

You have $10, and you want to make money in the stock market.  You find a company that you think is overvalued.  

You borrow 1 share of the company's stock from Jim that is worth $100.  You have $10 and 1 share.  You tell Jim that you'll give it back to him later, and you give him $5 now for his trouble. 

You turn around and sell that share to Rhonda for $100.

You have $105 and no shares. 

You wait. 

A few months later, market forces end up driving the value of the company down, so you are able to buy 1 share from Steve for $50.

You have $55 and 1 share. 

You go back to Jim and give him the share that you owe. 

You have $55. 

You turned $10 into $55 by betting against the value of stock that you didn't even own when you started.</text>

    <text>It's similar to how a bank will use the money that you deposit into your account to loan out to someone else.  

*  As a analogy, say you deposit $1000 into your bank.  You usually get some sort of interest on the money in your account.

* With the current rules, your bank can use that money (usually some % of the total, I'm not sure what though) to make more money for themselves.

* Now, Bob needs a loan for $500.  Bob can borrow the "bank's" money, the bank charges him interest on the loan. 

In this analogy:

* Your $1000 would be the original stock
* The bank is the broker.
* Bob is the guy who borrowed the stock (to short).  

When shorting stock, the shorter has to pay a fee to the broker on the stock (depending on a bunch of factors) they're borrowing. 

And the person who originally owns the stock gets a small fee from the broker for letting them lend out the stock.</text>

This week is all about shortening. Let's say I want to shorten, but have a limit in gains or loses as I don't have all day to watch the stock evolve. Can I shorten on stock Y that is at $10 and then place an order to buy again at $8 or $12 and whatever comes first cancels the other one? Is cancelling only one way also an option?</text>

    <text>This is one theory why the brokers stopped allowing buys on stock or options in GME and other meme stocks (but conspicuously allowed sells? hence the foul play accusations when the entire squeeze strategy depends on holding and buying dips and strictly \*not\* selling). Their clearing houses don't have enough liquidity to handle the true outstanding value of the shorts that get margin called. The IB chairman was on CNBC saying they have $5 billion in cash in their clearing house to handle transactions, but if something like $15 billion in shorts got margin called, you're right, there simply isn't enough cash to handle the transaction.

Paying everyone would require an amortization schedule. That's totally unimaginable.</text>

If I bleed one drop of blood a day, I wouldn't care, nor would my nemesis, right? So I guess interest (size) does matter?

I guess holding is a strategy to make them suffer only if either

* most of those shorts are based on short term loans, i.e. they all expire soon so shorters must buy expensively
* interest is really high
* loan value is really high so that even moderate interest costs a lot

And all of this is private information that retail investors are not privy to, if I understand correctly? Or am I missing some leaked contracts or other way we know they'll bleed?</text>

    <text>This finally makes sense to me.  I didn't know where was such a thing as borrowing within the market.  I thought they just sold it low and missed out of the fact that the price soared, which doesn't really compute to a loss - just a loss of the hypothetical winnings they would have have if they hadn't sold when they did.  But now I understand that they sold something that wasn't there's to sell, so they would have to make the real owner whole again by returning GME to their portfolio, even if they had to pay through the nose for it.

All of this is above my paygrade, which is why I'm not gamestop rich.</text>

    <text>You don't know what other people are going to do. 

If people sell shares they currently hold, the price of the stock falls. If enough people do it quickly, it falls dramatically. 

So if you buy in at a high price and wait too long to get out of the stock, you may get out at a much lower price, meaning you lose money.</text>

    <text>They borrowed so many stocks, they owe on over 140% of what they shorted. That's why they're in such deep crap. There isn't going to be any more to buy and eventually the Hedgefunds will HAVE to buy the stock at ANY price... Unless people sell. Which is why WSB is encouraging everyone to hold their stock at any cost. That squeeze could push the stock to $5000 per share.</text>

    <text>Thank you so much for starting this! I’ve been trying to explain it to friends and I want to make sure I understand it correctly. 
Ok, so I watch, idk “Macy’s” all the time, it’s my job. I watch them so often I familiarize myself with their product lineup and sales and I’m really good at predicting when and how much things will be on sale. Right now plaid tunics are selling at $100. I know that they’re going on sale in a week, so I “borrow” (put 100 tunics on layaway) and sell them to Jenny for $100. Next week they go on sale and I finalize my purchase (pay for my layaway that I already sold to Jenny) at $50 thereby profiting $5000. 
One day I do this same thing but plaid tunics got featured in a Cosmo article or some ish and so now they’re not on sale and in fact they’re $500 because Bob bought them all and it’s going to take awhile for them to get more in stock. I already borrowed them and sold them so I either have to pay $500 to Bob or extend my layaway with weekly fees until Bob stops buying them. Except Bob is taking all the tunics with him in a rocket ship never to be seen again. Is this correct?</text>

Selling call options is how that happened.  If I sell you a call option, I'm promising to sell you 100 shares at a specific price.  If the specific price is, say, $25 and I sell a thousand of these options to people, and the price of the stock goes to $100...I am now short 100,000 shares, none of which I had to go out and locate and borrow</text>

    <text>It's their business. And if you spread yourself around properly it's practically a license to print money. Any index fund can earn free money when indexes go up. Short sales can make money when markets are tanking. Hedge Funds can be a few dozen up to a few thousand people doing diligence and automating processes. Most make a killing. Occasionally they flame out. If Melvin actually dies, then the manager will be shamed out of the business but he'll still retire rich af.</text>

They were not in debt so no immediate threat of bankruptcy - just their current business model is becoming extinct.  So, there IS a case that the company could turn things around and become successful (CEO is former Chewy.com online shopping guru).  No, the company wouldn’t be worth hundreds of dollars, but could avoid tanking.</text>

    <text>Answer: If someone thinks that a company is overvalued in the stock market they can "short" the stock, this means they borrow a share from their broker (the platform where they buy and sell stock), sell it at the current price and hope to buy it back later in the future at a cheaper price to return it to the broker and keep the profits. 

For example, you think XYZ is too high at $10, you short it, sell it at $10 and 1 month later it is at $6, you close your position by buying it back and you made $4 per share.

The thing is that your maximum possible earning when shorting, is the price you short at, so if you short a stock at $10 and then it goes to $0 the maximum you make is $10, but the stock can go up and it can go up way more than $10 so the risk of shorting is higher because your losses can be very big.

Now if you shorted XYZ at $10 but the next month it is at $50, the broker will be asking you to "cover your position", you will need to place $40 as collateral (per share) or they will close it, because you borrowed from them, and also this loans can have interest to make things worse.

Some hedge funds saw that some companies were failing and the pandemic made things worse for them, so they started to short those companies, but the problem is that they shorted more shares than exist (it sounds weird but stocks are weird and reasons are complicated, like why does someone in WS NYC can make money from oil futures?), as i explained before, to profit from this shares they have to buy them back (hopefuly cheaper) and return them to the brokers. 

Some people found out that they were shorting more than a 100% of the shares and decided to start buying and holding shares (going long). If enough people does this and nobody is selling shares (or very few are selling) the price starts to go up and then the brokers start pressuring the shorters because, remember, they have to cover their positions. So at some point they will have to buy shares at ridiculous prices or keep covering their positions with billions of dollars that they have to pull from other investments or even the cost of covering is bigger that what the fund is valued at.

This is called short squeezing, it happened in 2008 with VW where some funds did it to other shorting funds and at some point they were trading for $1,000 per share.

In the current situation, normal, regular people are the ones holding, mostly coordinated from wallstreetbets, which is very strange because this had always happened between mayor WS corporations but this time, lay folks got the upper hand and it transformed into a movement where they are not trying to get some quick bucks and get out but instead force wall street to suffer what they have done in the past.</text>

    <text>A few months back some folks on /r/WallStreetBets discovered that certain hedge funds had shorted GameStop (GME). Shorting is when you promise to buy a set amount of a stock in the future - you make money off of it if the value of the stock decreases, because it costs you less than the money that was fronted to buy a set amount of a stock if that stock's value drops. And I mean, they had REALLY shorted it, promising to buy more GameStop stock than actually exists in the universe. They did this because they assumed that the company would declare bankruptcy and therefore the stocks would be worth nothing, meaning big profits if you shorted it. So the savvy autists (their own nickname for themselves) over at /r/WallStreetBets decided to take advantage of the situation, by doing what is called a gamma squeeze. A gamma squeeze is when you organize a large group of people to buy up a stock, so that its value grows larger - and everyone involved in buying the stock gains profit because they bought it low and can now sell it high. And so thousands of redditors started to buy Gamestop stock in vast amounts. By making the stock that was so heavily shorted suddenly INCREASE in value, that means when the date of the short comes up, the companies invested in the short are obligated to buy a set amount of now very expensive, overpriced stock. The net losses so far are close to $70 million for some of the largest hedge funds on the planet, and technically GameStop is now a Fortune 500 company. We did it, reddit!</text>

    <text>I disagree. Short sellers are in a unique infinite loss scenario. Theoretically, share prices could exceed $5,000. Your argument is that it will not, which is valid. However, it is not impossible. I believe that it will reach 4 digits.</text>

    <text>What I don't understand though — why would the people lending these shares to the short sellers.... do that? Why would you lend someone money when you know it's going to come back as less money?

Just thinking about someone coming up to me and saying, "hey, can I borrow your car", and me replying, "sure, but you have to give it back eventually". If they then said "No problem! But I'm going to give it back after I put a bunch of wear and tear on it and crash it a few times so it's worth less than it is now", I'd tell them to fuck off. What is the lender's thinking?</text>

    <text>Well whether they will go bankrupt or not is an open question.  They have some new management, maybe they will survive.  Maybe they will go bankrupt.  But the fundamentals definitely have not changed GME from a 500 million to a 13 billion company overnight.

I am fascinated to see how the system as a whole will handle this oddity.</text>

    <text>The part I'm most confused about is the holding part. They sound like they want to hold forever. I would have assumed that waiting until an extremely high price and all collectively selling would hurt the most? The plan is to eventually sell right? It sounds like they want to hold the stocks forever and never actually sell. Would holding indefinitely not just mean that the "short" will never be forced to be repaid as its never being sold? So basically a stalemate.</text>

    <text>They recognized that hedge funds were borrowing shares and selling them to drive prices of popular stocks down. The same hedge funds would buy back shares when the price dropped and give them back to whom they borrowed. This is called “shorting” a stock

Wall Street Bets was fed up with this market manipulation, so they banded together and made a vow not to sell their shares no matter what. So they would pump the stock, a stock they already liked anyways, and when shorts came to drive it back down to the original price, they would just hold their position and never sell.

Eventually the shorts would be forced to buy back the stock to return what they had borrowed. Funny thing, this would drive the price up even higher! Then shorts would double down on their position because they think, “Well now it’s for sure overvalued.” People just kept holding, and shorts just kept losing money.</text>

    <text>I borrow a share of your stock that's currently worth 10$, which I immediately sell to someone else (for 10$). I don't owe you 10$, I owe you "one share". A week later, due to market fluctuation, shares are only worth 6$. I buy one from someone else and give it back to you, since I owe you one. I made 4$ in the process. Makes sense?</text>

Regardless of what WSB can do by pumping money into a destined-to-fail-already business, won’t the folks here get left holding the bag eventually if the hedge funders can just ride it out?</text>

    <text>Couldn't find the answer here so asking out loud.
 Why would the hedge fund quitting? Why don't they wait instead for all this come back to "aftermath" and quit with less damage or even some profit? What makes us be sure that the price will remain high for a long period?
 What is Gamestop profit? (As I understood they probably don't have any $GME at all so the rising price made nothing for them but for traders?). But if they become a very rich company overnight will they succeed to manage it the proper way and keep the stock price high for a long time? As I know you can be in short position for very long time, so the hedge fund might just wait and do some media job to speed up the rage of mass.</text>

    <text>By far the most common way to buy and sell stocks is through a market.  A market is a brokered list of many available offers.  It looks sort of like this:

| # wanted | Price | # offered |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| | $1.02 | 10 |
| | $1.01 | 5 |
| 5 | $1.00 | |
| 5 | $0.99 | |

The number in the middle is the price per share and the numbers on the outside are how many shares are currently offered at that price.  A real market goes a long way up and down and might have millions of shares wanted or offered at any given time.

You can also offer to buy/sell at market price.  In the market above, if I bought 10 at market, I would get 5 at $1.01 and 5 at $1.02 and the new price would be $1.02.   Likewise, if I sold 10 at market, the new price would be $0.98.  If they both came in at the same time, they would settle for $1.00 or $1.01.

Very large deals are often done privately but, for anything smaller, markets are quick and efficient.</text>

    <text>A gamma squeeze generates the same effect (rise of stock price) but by buying options instead of real stocks. And yes, each event affect the other.

Options are easy to understand but hard to master. Expert investors can do crazy things combining short calls, long calls, short puts and/or long puts to perform several kinds of hedge, speculation or arbitrage strategies.

A key difference is stocks are limited in supply, options are not. Anybody can write in MS WORD: "I give you the right, but not the obligation, to buy/sell me 100 shared in 30 days at $50 each". print 500 copies and sell them to one or more people.</text>

    <text>A key component in a gamma squeeze is that you can create and sell options out of thin air, and buy an option back to cancel it out.

Market makers like Citadel make money by having lots of orders and getting better buy and sell prices between those orders than anyone else (just by virtue of having so many orders to pick from.) So, they pay brokerages tiny fees per order to get each of them.

In a gamma squeeze, a market maker starts selling calls that they don't have, giving them a net negative number of calls. Since the market maker doesn't actually want any skin in the game (in the GME lol) they'll buy shares to cancel out the effect of the option. 

How many shares? Well there's a complicated formula to calculate this depending on how likely it is to pay out, but it's called delta. For example I have an AMC option with 0.87 delta, meaning it counts as 87 shares (yeah everything is multiplied by 100 it's confusing, also the max delta is 1). Delta is not constant and will increase if the stock price rises. This rate of increase is called gamma (my AMC option has 0.01 gamma meaning if AMC goes up a dollar my delta will go up by 1).

The squeeze happens when lots of people are buying really far out lofty call options. Since they're so far out they have pretty low delta and I the market maker don't have to buy a whole lot of shares. But due to gamma, if the stock price skyrockets, the delta does too, and suddenly I have to buy millions of shares to make sure I'm not exposed. But market makers can be so big that their increase in demand will increase the stock price even more! And people might even start buying more call options!! That's a gamma squeeze.</text>

So in order to close the deal, Bert needs to buy back 3 apples from Carl to give back to Alice and Danny needs to buy them back from (let's call her) Emily to give back to Carl? But Carl can't sell them back to Bert because he hasn's got them anymore.

Are there any contracts between all these people on deadlines, or that Bert can get the apples only back from Carl and nobody else?

And what's happening now is that Bert gets nervous to give the apples back to Alice but can't buy them anywhere for less than he sold them, right?</text>

    <text>&gt;Who initially owns these shares that are being borrowed? GameStop themselves? Other investors?

Generally it's other investors who own the stock 

&gt; What does the owner get out of lending out their shares? If they're getting a cut of the short seller's profit, why wouldn't they just sell off their shares themselves? If they expect the value to tank in the future, wouldn't just selling now ensure the maximum amount of profit?

The owner charges a fee for lending it out. Generally that fee is expressed as a % interest rate on the price of the stock at the time of lending, like the interest rate on a credit card or a loan. For a stable stock, that fee might be a few % a year. For an in-demand, volatile stock like GME, the fee might be 50% or more per year (because there's much more demand for shorting it, so people can charge higher fees). For people who own the stock, these interest payments are pretty much free money, because they are guaranteed to get their stock back, plus they get interest on top.

&gt;If it's expected for a stock to tank, who are the people 'buying' the shares of the short seller?

People disagree on what the value of a stock will be in the future. No one explicitly sets the price for a stock generally - the implementation details can be a bit complicated, but big-picture, people who own a stock and want to sell it give the stock exchange an order that looks like "I want to sell 20 shares of XYZ at any price above $15 each". Later, someone else who wants to buy the stock sends the exchange an order that looks like "I want to buy 10 shares of XYZ at any price below $17 each". The exchange sees that it can match these orders, so it conducts a transaction of 10 shares from the seller to the buyer at a price that's in range for both orders - in this case it might be $16 a share. When you see a quote for a given stock on google or CNN or whatever, generally you're seeing the price at which the most recent order was "filled" for that stock on the exchange.</text>

    <text>A short squeeze is where people who have sold the stock short are forced to buy back the stock as their accounts “blow up” (they run out of money as their GME short liabilities rise and are forced to close everything out). 

A gamma squeeze has to do with the way people (really institutional investors) hedge when they sell options. These players are trying to play the role of the facilitator, and not take on risk one way or the other (think like a bookie trying to set odds where they come out slightly ahead no matter what). 

Essentially, if you sell a call option to a WSB trader, to eliminate the risk from this sale you need to buy shares of the underlying stock. The more YOLO the option, the less the seller needs to buy since the risk of the sale is lower (high probability of the WSB trader losing everything).

But, if the price of the underlying steadily rises, the odds of that YOLO option paying out goes way up, which causes the option seller to buy more shares to reduce their risk. This adds more buying pressure to the stock, which then triggers more hedging by the options sellers. When these options become in the money (ITM), they are able to be exercised for shares when they expire on a set date. So eventually, the sellers of ITM options on expiration will need to have bought 100 shares of the underlying for each call contract. This places immense buying pressure on the stock, and could trigger losses large enough to cause the short squeeze above.</text>

    <text>Is it worth buying any shares (if there are any available at this point) and if so, how many shares does it take to make money? 

If I were to buy 1 share and hold on to it, is that enough to have any effect? or are we talking buying in the hundreds/thousands of shares?

Thank you for any answers, I hope I worded these questions right, it’s late where I am haha

Edit: thank you everyone for your fantastic answers and thank you for dealing with my wording haha. I really appreciate it and my itch has been satisfied, I think I’ll leave the market for the more savvy at this point; however it is nice to know that a few shares is enough to work with. Happy weekend to y’all and good luck to those with shares and market prowess!!</text>

    <text>Can someone explain why people are saying the short sellers should get fucked though? It seems like an entirely rational move to borrow a stock that you believe will be lower in the future in order to make some extra money on this movement. I understand that more has been borrowed than exists but is each person/company that is shorting aware of the available shares to be borrowed? Cant really fault them if there is no live counter of whats available to be borrowed.</text>

    <text>So I want to start investing, and plan to soon. What I am concerned with is me messing something up and owing money somehow.

My question is if I put lets say 2k into fidelity and buy stocks there is no way I can lose more than 2k initially?
I see people on Wallstreetbets who look like they owe money somehow, I don't understand it lol.

All I really want to do is buy and hold stock, maybe sell months later if I made a few bucks.


Edit: Thanks for all the informative replies!</text>

    <text>This has been a long time since I did this so I hope I am still correct.

The lenders typically get paid a fee for the duration of the short position.  Typically the lenders are banks or other funds who own the stock.  The Lenders are willing to lend the stock because either it goes up in value and their investment grows, or the stock goes down in value and the lending fee lowers their exposure to the loss.

The people "buying" are usually other banks or hedge funds.</text>

    <text>Gamma is how a change in price leads to a change in your position. Market makers try to be gamma neutral (they don't care about uppies or downies). If people buy a lot of calls, this makes them gamma negative (stock goes up, they go down). So they hedge by buying shares.


Gamma squeeze is where you buy enough calls that they start having to buy a lot of shares causing the share price to go up. Check out softbank and tesla for an example.</text>

    <text>&gt; Who initially owns these shares that are being borrowed? GameStop themselves? Other investors?

Other investors. 

&gt; What does the owner get out of lending out their shares? 

The short seller pays them interest.  

&gt; If it's expected for a stock to tank, who are the people 'buying' the shares of the short seller? 

People who think it won't tank/

&gt; Are these transactions always between a 'buyer' and a 'seller' who have to agree on the price?

Yes.  You either place a buy order or sell order.  When you do so, you either set a price or say 'around the last transaction price'.  The broker then matches a seller and buyer.

&gt;why would someone buy a share that's being shorted?

Stocks are usually shorted when people believe a stock will crash - there is usually an outside factor driving that assumption like a risk of bankruptcy or people valuing the company too much.  If the market thinks there is a risk of bankruptcy then they will discount the value of a stock (risk) - a short seller bets it will happen 'soon', the purchaser might think the risk is minimal or doesn't exist.</text>

    <text>Again, i know nothing about stocks. But why is the concept of a hedge fund not illegal in itself, specialised buying powers and a pool of people buying at once sounds sketchy. Also the idea of shorting, making money off companies going under. Why is that a thing, or is it just a by product of having a market? Should there not be a cap on the amout of  shorts as percentage otherwise its incentized that businesses fail, not for the businesses themselves but for others. Big fish eats the little fish.</text>

Also iv seen people say its the reverse of what hedge funds usually do. How do they usually unfairly make money, they obviously have massive finacial leverage but how do they use that leverage to make more?</text>

    <text>Note there is no limit to how much the short-sellers have to pay for the stocks. 

Just a guess, if they short sold at $40, planning to resolve 2 days later when the stock was $39, they could have invested in a million shares because they're only making $1 on each ... but the stock price rises to $440 and suddenly that $1 million they were going to make turns into $400 million they owe.</text>

    <text>Who owns the shares?  

Could be anyone that has a share and in some situations, even the brokerages are lending YOUR shares to other people.

What does the lender get? 

They get a interest or fee payment out of it.  Think of it like any other loan, but sometimes the lender is Tony Two Times the Mafia collector and he will take everything you have to settle the debt if you dont pay.

Who are buying the the shares from the short seller?

They were sold a long time ago.  Think renting a car that you believe will go down in value for two weeks, you SELL the rented car to someone today and are betting that you can buy another car a few weeks later for less money to return it to the rental lot.  The rental lot gets their car back and you pocket the money selling it now and buying it back later at a cheaper price; the rental lot just wants their car and doesnt care what you did with it.   The big issue right now is that they sold the car and then a bunch of other people decided that Ford Fiesta was awesome and bought every Fiesta there was and the price is 1000X what it was worth a few weeks ago.  Now you gotta pay 1000X the price to get a car to return to the lot else they will take your house to pay for the car.</text>

    <text>It's a contract between a holder and the borrower. Usually the borrower will pay a fee to borrow the stock, imagine it as rent. Often low cost brokers will lend out their customers holdings to make a profit.</text>

    <text>2. They loan them out for a flat fee. Basically, they get paid $10 or whatever for each stock they loan back, and later at whatever time, they get the stock back. 

Are they borrowing from everyday people? Noy positive on the details but I think they borrow from brokerages. say I open a stock account with robinhood, and buy 3 shares or Gamestop (GME). I don't physically get paper shares from robinhood, they hold onto them for me till I have them sell. And while they hold on to them, they might be loaning them out to short sellers for their profit (I don't get a cut).</text>

    <text>1) since there really aren't paper stock certificates anymore, the brokerage is the middleman that will conduct the trade for you to own the stock. You own the stock, while the brokerage or trading platform "holds" it in their system. You could tell the brokerage you want to move it to another brokerage and they would hand over the shares to the new firm.
If available, you could use something called Direct Stock Purchase Plan (DSPP) through Compushare which is where you directly purchase stock from the company.

2) you can call your brokerage and tell them you do not want your shares to be lent out or shorted against.

3) not sure what you are asking</text>

    <text>There are a lot of questions as to whether Robinhood and other brokerage firms can stop the trading of stock. I'm not here to argue right or wrong, but I want to present the facts. 

Any broker at any time for any reason can stop trading (brokering) any stock. You actually see this a lot with stocks on the pink sheets. Many brokers can and will stop trading for a variety of reasons. One example would be the company is under scrutiny by the SEC for funny books. The brokerage firm feels that brokering that stock for it's customers is a danger to them, and the firm itself, so they will shut trading. 

They can also shut down trading for retail investors on the stock and keep it open for institutional investors. They can do this because they are the broker. They decide how they operate. Just like you can choose one of your friends to loan $10 to but not the other because you don't trust the second to pay you back. 

Again, this is legal and allowed. In the wider view just because Vanguard doesn't allow you to trade shares in XYZ doesn't mean you can't go over to TD and buy XYZ through them. Each broker is independent and can choose what trades they allow through.

Again, is this morally right or wrong? That's for you to decide.</text>

    <text>You create an account with a broker, deposit money, find a company or fund that you like, decide the price is reasonable, then you buy it. Simple as that. Now you can sell it whenever you want: maybe it didn't do well, maybe it did and you're afraid it will drop, maybe you see better opportunities, maybe you need the cash for something.

There are many different ways to buy and sell and tons of ways to enter and exit positions but that is the gist of it.</text>

    <text>It's a little more than this, as the short sellers typically aren't required to actually return the shares on any given date (but are only required to pay some of the losses they've occured every so often). This means that they happily hold on to the shares until the price goes down and they make a profit, or unless the price goes up and they buy to limit their losses. What the WSB guys realised is that if they can force the stock price up a bit then some of the short sellers will try and buy too to limit their losses, driving the price up further, causing more short sellers to try and buy, causing a loop that drives the prices sky high.

The price would continue to rise until all the short sellers who are trying to buy out manage to do so, and then would collapse. This means that in these sort of situations the people who have got shares to sell (that is WSB in this case) need to sell before that happens or they don't actually make any money - this puts a limit on the price rise, as people who hold shares will be more inclined to sell as the price goes up (and they think the bubble might burst) and it will slow down or collapse actually before the short sellers are done. What's dubiously legal in this case is that WSB has essentially made a pact *not* to sell their shares until the price reaches a particular level but rather to keep buying, which is market manipulation.

&amp;#x200B;

They've been cut off from buying more stocks on the common sites they use and are screaming that it's market manipulation but this is just projection; WSB is the group doing dubiously legal things.</text>

    <text>1. Other investors or financial institutions. Rarely will a company lend shares, they usually just buy/sell to raise capital/regain ownership as needed.

2. If I lend you shares, I'm also going to charge you interest on the value borrowed. This is in part because you think they're going to drop and I won't be able to sell them.

3. Other people/institutions buy the shares. The reason to buy a share that's being shorted is if you think the person with the short position is wrong. If a lot of people (or a few wealthy people) believe the short is very wrong they will buy the stock and increase its value in what is called a "short squeeze". This is because the person who shorted the stock will at some point have to buy some back to "cover" their position. In this case the short position is so large (&gt;100% of the shares) that the short seller will have to buy back ALL the shares which dramatically pumps up their value.</text>

    <text>As an answer to number two, it’s essentially the same sorta thing as owning property, you rent it out and then turn a blind eye on what happens, all you know is that the prearranged date comes and you get your property back as well as rent, it’s insanely safe for them, unless the hedge fund that borrows them goes bankrupt, at which point I’m not sure what happens if they don’t get a government bailout</text>

If you want to gamble, put your money in. All the math checks out, and in theory, Gamestop stock will continue to skyrocket until the shorts are significantly reduced.

But be aware that some serious investing firms stand to lose billions. They are not playing nice, and it turns out that people with billions can change the rules when they see fit.</text>

    <text>Its an old 4chan meme dating back a few years, related to a self deprecating joke on how the users of the site are manchildren and for such people the object of most desire is chicken tenders (a common dish at American restaurants primarily for children), pronounced in a childlike manner as "tendies."

WSB co-opts a lot of 4chan language and a similar style of self deprecating humor. The joke here is that the gains made are spent on tendies, though at this point its used synonymously with money.

    <text>It seems pretty apparent to me that the worth of $GME is not being affected by the tangible real world worth and assets of the company, but rather based on the perceived worth of those using the markets. 

What are the implications of stock prices not necessarily being tied to the actual profitability and assets of a company? How can GameStop benefit from this?</text>

    <text>The apps are services that allow you to trade (buy or sell) stocks, funds, crypto and other products with your own money.  

Stocks are given out by a company, they represent part of the company's value. If the company does well, its stocks rise.    

The stock prices vary because people are continuously trading a stock for money. They buy stocks when they think the price is going to go up and sell stocks when they think it's going down. If you buy a stock, someone on the other side of the internet needs to sell it to you. The price agreed upon determines the stock price.  
The trade actions over time are shown using candle sticks, the famous green and red bars.   

Hold is just a trade strategy. Instead of continuously buying and selling, you buy something and then wait until the price increases, regardless of what happens in between.    

Eventually people will sell stocks as the goal is usually to make money. But massive selling decreases the stock price because you are competing with a lot of other sellers. So it is best for holders if someone else doesn't sell. 
    
The trading is risky, you can lose money. So if you make a profit, that is well deserved if you ask me. In the case of GME the opportunity was there and the actions taken by Reddit investors were smart which caused the price to rise. But it can be seen as suspicious trading by some.  
  
Moon simply means that a price has skyrocketed.   

Elon just likes to joke around because he knows he is influencing a lot of people. He says Doge and everyone buys Doge.</text>

    <text>1. Stock Lenders

The transaction (known as a "short sale") is initiated by an individual or organization (known as a "short seller"), who desires to "short" a stock. He interacts with the "Buyer" who is the person saying "Okay, I will buy a share of GME stock from you" Once the stock is sold short, the short seller must deliver the stock to the buyer. The buyer cannot differentiate whether the seller is a short seller or a long seller of stock -- nor do they care. The buyer is only interested in receiving the stock they have paid for. The short seller has a problem though. He or she does not own the stock sold to the buyer. Hence, the short seller must *borrow* the stock to be able to deliver it to the buyer. How? The short seller will utilize a selling broker to arrange to borrow the stock from a stock lender to be used to satisfy the short seller's sale of stock to the buyer. This transaction takes place in a margin (debt) account and might have other economic consequences (Like if the stock in question goes up 10x and the poor short seller becomes in debt up to his eyeballs). Please note that in some instances, the selling broker may in fact be the stock lender while in other circumstances, the selling broker must borrow stock from a third party securities lender. When the buyer receives the stock and pays for it, he or she is satisfied and no longer has any involvement in the transaction. The other three parties (the short seller, selling broker and stock lender) are still linked together by the stock loan.

So at this point, there is no more "Buyer" all you have now is the "Short Seller" who owes the  "Stock Lender" a share of GME. and often, that Stock Lender is also the Selling Broker.

2. The Lender usually just gets lending fees. It's 0 risk money. The same way a stock broker doesn't care of you bought 100 Shares of Disney and made 10 thousand dollars, they just want to have as many transactions as possible because they make money per transaction.

It may be easier for you to think of shorting a stock as "Buying" negative shares of a stock. If I want to buy -10 shares of gamestop, somebody out there (esp yesterday) is TOTALLY willing to buy 10 shares to balance me out. So a lender/broker comes in to say

"Ya, let's give this short seller his -10 shares and slap him with an IOU, give the buyer his 10 shares which is super easy, and now we have an IOU from this short seller and we don't care of he makes money or loses money because really we're just making money off the top of each transaction"  


*edit* 

It's important to note here that the broker/lender is only willing to extend the Short Seller SO much credit.   


So let's say a hedgefund comes in when the stock is at $100 and says "HAHA WERE GONNA MAKE BILLIONS, SHORT $100 MILLION OF GME" the broker may say "Okay, we're willing to write you that IOU for 1 million shares, which right now means a $100mil loan, but I'm only willing to extend you $200mil worth of credit, so if those GME shares hit the $200 mark, you HAVE to pay us back our shares, which means buying the shares back yourself to do so"   


Then the Hedgefund in their ignorance goes "PSH EASY, NO WAY THE STOCK GOES THAT HIGH BECAUSE ITS OBVIOUSLY GONNA TANK" and they agree to it.   


Guess what, when that stock goes up to $200, now the hedgefund has to buy BACK at DOUBLE their price the stock, to pay back the lender. They lose their initial $100 mil, they lose ANOTHER $100mil which is the crazy growth of the stock they bet against, AND the $200mil they spent buying back their shares? Well, that just looks like MORE SHARES BOUGHGT FOR GME AND THE GROWTH CONTINUES</text>

If you're willing to lose it all and just want to have some fun with it, sure, buy the dip and sell off once you've made a bit of profit that you're happy with. Unless they pull more illegal shit, the price will continue to rise. Don't try to time the market and sell off early.</text>

    <text>Nope, it’s only speculative. That’s why WSB is telling everyone to hold and not sell anything.

There is also a forced limit called Margin call, where if the losses becomes too big they have to complete the deal and buy stocks no matter what price. They literally can’t postpone anymore.

If you look at other squeezes, that’s when the price jumps like 10x in one day before crashing instantly

But this is deep water for me, so I can’t guarantee I got it all right. As funny as it is, there will be a crash eventually and a lot of people and companies will lose money. And a lot of people will gain money.</text>

It can add up to complicated processes, but in the end / simplest terms, its anyone who owns the stock and feels like lending them out, yes.

&gt; What does the owner get out of lending out their shares?

Fees. They charge fees to lend them out.

&gt; If it's expected for a stock to tank, who are the people 'buying' the shares of the short seller?

Its just the way it works. For stocks that have moderate volume, it may be hard to believe but theres just almost always someone out there that will buy them during the entire fall to 0.</text>

    <text>When you buy a stock on margin, since you are technically borrowing the money from the brokerage they have the right to sell the short side of it. If margin rates are increased it might lead to people getting margin called and having to make the decision of holding onto different assets(a lot of people had margin called and would rather sell out of long positions than GME). Trading stock is technically contracted. You have the right or obligation to buy something once you press send and the order is confirmed.        

Someone would lend their stock because they can make an interest rate on the stock and manipulate the market by having both the buy and sell side. So after both sides sell out and they own the market they can move it up and down at their will(use call and put options to hedge and just sell the options instead of exercising. Anton Kreil has a good explanation of how this works).         

People lend and benefit from that. I’m going to laugh if people on margin switched over to cash because margin requirements are 100% so there’s no point in letting your share go to someone that is causing a market depression. Might as well move it to cash, force the short sellers to cover, and make the stock go to another solar system. 🚀🚀🚀.

    <text>Short selling is a promise to sell.

What you are doing is saying “I will give you this stock some time in the future for the price it is at right now.”

If a stock is worth $10, you will collect the money with the promise that you will give that stock in the future. If that stock’s price lowers to $5, then you will be able to buy the stock at $5 to fill your promise, earning the difference between what you received for it and what you paid for it.

However, should that stock’s price rise, you must still fill that promise. If the stock’s price becomes $20, you must then buy stock you promised to give, even if you only got $10 for it in the first place.

What’s happening is these people collected their $10 per stock with a promise to sell, and now they have to fill their promise. But they don’t have any stock on hand (since they were expecting to buy it when it got lower), so they have to buy stock for more than what they received for it. Still more difficult, *there aren’t any stocks available for them to buy*, but they still have to fill that promise, no matter how expensive it becomes.</text>

    <text>&gt; Who initially owns these shares that are being borrowed? GameStop themselves? Other investors?

The, well, shareholders do. Anyone who owns a share can lend it out (it is, after all, something you own and generally do what you like with), however doing so with appropriate legal and contractual sense is tricky, so generally only large organizations and brokerages will do that. It's similar to how a bank does not sit on your money but instead loans it out; a brokerage does not necessarily keep your stocks but instead loans them out.

&gt; What does the owner get out of lending out their shares? If they're getting a cut of the short seller's profit, why wouldn't they just sell off their shares themselves? If they expect the value to tank in the future, wouldn't just selling now ensure the maximum amount of profit?

The borrower pays the lender an upfront fee for borrowing the stock. I'll answer the second question in the next part.

&gt; If it's expected for a stock to tank, who are the people 'buying' the shares of the short seller? Are these transactions always between a 'buyer' and a 'seller' who have to agree on the price? 

As an example:

Stock ABC is worth $20 right now and I own a single share. I think it will be worth $50 by June, which is why I'm holding onto it---while I think the price might fluctuate some, I'd rather not risk the potential $30 gain chasing small dollar drops. 

I have two friends, Bob and Carol, that think the stock will drop next week: Bob thinks it will drop to $12, Carol thinks only $15. Bob is willing to pay me up to $7 to borrow the stock, while Carol is only willing to pay me up to $4 (allowing either at least $1 profit), and so I sell it to Bob for $5. I'm happy, having made $5, Bob is happy, looking forward to making $2, and Carol will have to look for a different deal. Bob then sells the stock for $20 to someone who, maybe thinks the stock will go to $40 by June.

Come next week, and the price of the stock has changed. Regardless of what the current price is, Bob needs to buy the stock back to give to me. If he was right, then hopefully you understand why he wanted to short the stock as he made money. If he was wrong, then you should understand why I wanted to hold onto the stock rather than sell it, as I made money. But since we don't know the future, both of us are justified in our strategy.</text>

    <text>These are called brokers. These are the groups that do the actual trading on Wall Street. Consider them as sort of a middle man. 

Redditors are taking the money of groups that are doing something called shorting a stock - there’s plenty of comments on this already.

Do you just sit down? Well, kind of. A good investor need to keep track of a stock that’s frequently moving, especially with GME. Most stocks don’t change at this rate though.

Holding essentially means not selling a share/stock. If people sell their shares, they become less valuable. Sometimes a lot of people end up panic selling shares, causing massive drops or crashes in the price of a stock.

5000 is kind of a joke, that most likely won’t happen.

They are buying “shares”, or small percentages of companies. The value of these changes depending on supply or demand. If there’s a high supply and low demand of a share, the price will be low/get lower, and vice versa.

While a lot of people are holding and taking that chance, many people want to go the safe route and just exit with a profit they’ve made without risking it. 

Nobody is going to space, people are saying “to the moon” in reference to wanting the stock price to go up</text>

    <text>The terminology originated on 4chan. It's common lingo on there, especially in a memey and/or self-deprecating context.

A lot of them are being semi-serious. To them, "autist" and "retard" are self-descriptive (and often self-deprecating) terms that explain someone's feeling of being socially disconnected, awkward, and not "getting" people-- as well as sometimes having unusual, stereotypically "weeaboo", or niche/nerdy interests. And sometimes, it's just flat out "I think I'm a dumb person and have a low opinion of myself." 

When they say stuff like calling themselves a "complete retard", for example, they're being self-deprecating while saying something like "I'm not an expert and don't know what I'm doing/can't even pretend I know what I'm talking about, but this is my opinion/I'm doing x". And when they say "fellow retards" they mean "we're all probably doing a hugely stupid thing, but I believe in what we're doing and we're in this together."

They're not being intentionally offensive to people with autism. 4chan lingo tends to abuse the English language and change the meaning and weight of words in weird ways-- for a long time, "faggot" and "fag" were widely used on 4chan in a way that had nearly nothing to do with either gay folks or cigarettes. People would call themselves and each other these terms, sometimes as insults, sometimes as endearment, and sometimes as a neutral way of identifying who was (or wasn't) part of a certain "in" group-- e.g namefag (someone who wasn't anonymous), newfag (someone who was clearly a new user), oldfag (old/long-time user), etc. Using this terminology was a way of signaling you understood and spoke the local language.

"Autist" and "retard" are often used similarly now. They also have an added benefit of weeding out people who find that language offensive and preventing them from participating normally, which acts as a filter for what the demographic makeup of such communities tend to be.</text>

    <text>Here's what I don't understand: why do the hedge funds have to pay for the stock now? It seems pretty obvious that Gamespot's elevated price is unsustainable and it will crash back down very, very far. If the hedge fund just rode it out a week or a month, they would be fine.

Are they only allowed to carry a certain amount of "debt" (not exactly the right word) against the shares they borrowed, and that forced their hand? Did they just panic and think the stock would just keep on rising and never fall back down?</text>

    <text>What's the incentive for loaning out shares I own? I'm assuming there's some sort of fee or interest (if not the whole premise of my understanding is flawed), but it's pretty obvious that whoever is asking to borrow them has somehow predicted that my fees would be offset by their profits - which would be identical to my losses. Logic says they're expecting me to lose more than they'll have to pay me. Why would I do that?</text>

    <text>1) generally the shares are owned by individual people, by other companies, by big funds, and some may be owned by gamestop itself. A public company will usually have millions of owners. 
2) most of the time the owners won't even know their share is gone. A broker like Robinhood holds people's share in their accounts, and can lend them out to others without you even knowing.  
The reason why people (or brokers) lend their shares out is because they usually get interest payments for loaning them out.
3) The reason the holders of the stock don't sell them themselves is probably because they don't believe the value will fall. Basically no one actually knows what will happen and so in a market with a lot of people, some will be positive and some will be negative on the future value

For stocks, there is a bid price and an ask price. The bid price is the highest price someone will buy for and the ask price is the lowest someone will sell for.  If this numbers are far apart, then no trades happen, but if they are close, then a trade happens.  For most companies, millions of shares can trade everyday with lots and lots of buyers and sellers, so there is rarely a gap. The price of the stock is basically what the last share sold for. So if the last person sold a stock at 30 and there is no one else willing to sell any lower, the next person who wants to buy needs to bid a higher price (say 31) in order to find someone new willing to sell. That is why the price moves up and down as willingness to pay a certain price changes all the time.</text>

    <text>I think I understand the basics of shorting, one thing I can't wrap my head around is what's in it for the first person who lends out their stock to only receive it back when the short expires? Do they charge a fee for loaning out their share? Why don't they just hold it the whole time?</text>

    <text>another thing that must be emphasized, is that these hedge funds shorted GME from when it was &gt;20$ down to 3 dollars/share.  So they had already made big profits.  But instead of being satisfied and closing their positions, they were greedy and wanted to totally short the company into the ground/bankruptcy, costing thousands of people their jobs.  its their fault they didn't see the risk, and they had plenty of chances to exit their positions when the stock started rising.</text>

    <text>1. The app is called Robinhood and they allow you to trade stock such as GameStop, ticker symbol (1-4 letter combo used to identify it) $GME
2. [Basic video of how the stock market works](https://youtu.be/p7HKvqRI_Bo). Emphasis on *basic*. Basically you can buy what are called shares of a company and if a lot more people buy than sell these shares their stock goes up and vice versa. Your profit (or loss) is calculated by the number of shares times the value you sold at.
3. Some do some don’t, those that do are called day traders, although most people might be watching GME since it is extremely volatile right now. 
4. People are saying hold because the hedge funds that are in huge trouble right now are trying to scare people into selling their GME shares. If people sell they lose less money but if people hold the stock continues to rise and everyone but the hedge funds make money.
5. $5k is an arbitrary number, I’d be shocked and rejoiced if it hit even $1000, at $5k you’d have made so much that at that point you want to sell to lock in at least a couple thousand dollars worth of gains (even if it hits $5k and you don’t sell if it drops down to $10 and then you sell you only get $10)
6. They are buying GME stock, technically called a security but it is more or less a publicly traded piece of the company 
7. The goal is as much as possible
8. Because people are scared and want to secure profits because since this is a volatile stock all their profits could be wiped out in literally 15 minutes if things go south. 
9. Everyone who jumped on early (~$20) goes to Pluto, those who got in under $100 are going to Mars, and everyone else is at least going to the moon. Means they will see huge profits pretty much.</text>

    <text>The answer varies depending how much money you have. 

If you’re a retail investor and using a brokerage through your bank chances are they have an inventory of various securities that you can buy/sell. In the case of GME where there was huge demand they likely coordinated with what’s known as a prime brokerage to acquire more stock. 

If you’re a high net worth individual or a large institutional investor, you call a prime brokerage and say “I want to buy 100,000 GME” and they give you the position in your account. On the bank’s books they are now short 100,000 and need to go to close out their position. This practice is known as market making. 

The large prime brokerages charge a commission to do this work. The trader’s job at the bank is to close out the position and lose as little of the commission (spread) as possible.</text>

    <text>Probably because most of them are going to eat a loss on this. Most of them are not buying it at the original low values these stocks like GME were selling for. When the stock prices go back down many of them will eat a loss so theyre calling themselves retards to make light of the fact that theyre hurting themselves to stick it to the hedge funds.

Also, if the original buyers sell now many of them could make hundreds of thousands or even millions but theyre choosing mot to make this profit just to fuck over the hudge funds as well.</text>

    <text>The lender gets profit from the fees paid by borrowers, plus they know they get their stock back no matter what. So if you loan out a $10 stock for $1, and the price rises to $100 all of a sudden, you still get that $100 stock back, + the $1 you got from loaning it out. If someone can’t get the stock back to you within the agreed time frame you get to charge them extortionate interest levels until they pay you back, so then you get the fee + the interest + your own stock back.</text>

    <text>Yeah, they go up to a big fund and essentially say, "hey, you're holding onto that Gamestop stock long-term right? Can I borrow some for 15 days? I'll pay you 2% of their value if you let me borrow them and I will sign a contract that I owe you the shares back. You weren't going to do anything but sit on them anyway, right?"

Then they sell the stock and if it goes down, they buy it and return the stock, and make money. But if it goes up, they still have to buy the stock and will loose money.

Obviously this is all automated but that's kind of how it works</text>

    <text>&gt; What are those apps?

-The apps are various stock trading apps/brokerages you can store money and purchase/sell stocks in

&gt; People keep mentioning (robinhood, GME*, etc.)

-Robinhood is a stock trading app that was pretty great until recently when they blocked everyone except firms/“big bois”/rich stock runners from buying, only giving normal people the option to sell their current stocks. This is a big no no because it’s no longer a “free market”, and it gives privileges to those same rich people/firms that lost billions over the past few days. It allowed them to try and make it back.

-GNE? Not sure, but GME is the gamestop stock, it’s what drove this crazy situation in the first place

&gt; How do stocks work?

-tbh I don't even feel qualified to answer that, as far as *what they are*. However, stocks work for the most part via supply and demand almost, they're essentially 'parts of a company' I guess? If you own stock in a company, you technically own a part of that company I think.

&gt; Who's money are the redditors taking?

-Redditors are taking the money of big firms/huge traders that like to “short” stocks (long story *short*: big boi says “hey let me borrow your stock”, they mass sell a bunch of them, the stock price for that item drops, they buy it back at a significantly lower price, and “return” the stock they borrowed, essentially pocketing the difference). Do enough big shorts and you could make millions.

&gt; Do you just sit on your ass all day and watch your computer stats go up and down?

-Sometimes people sit and watch all day but it’s more of a casual check every now and then, especially if you have money constantly going up or down based on stock prices.

&gt; Why are people saying "hold"?

-“Hold” in this case means do not sell your owned stock, as it will lower the price of the stock, hence giving the rich/firms/big traders the ability to fulfill their shorts and make money. If people hold their stocks, the price won’t change, probably increase as people buy more, and thus increasing the total loss for the people “shorting” the stock.

&gt; And why until 5000?

-5000 is arbitrary, just a high number since people like to sell at the first sight of a decent profit.

&gt; What exactly are they buying and how?

-"they" are regular people, buying shares of a company/organization

&gt; How much money will they get away with?

-Regular people can make a lot if done right, recently a redditor bought $50K in gamestop stock and it increased to the point where they now own $20-30 million.

&gt; If everyone is saying hold, why are some selling?

-Some people panic sell, it happens

&gt; and who tf is going to space?

-the stock is going to space🚀🚀🚀</text>

    <text>Trying so hard to understand this.  Here's what I think I've got. 

Johnny wants to short AA for $5.  He gives Molly that money for the stock.  Molly tells Johnny he has until Friday to complete his short. Meanwhile Billy and his friends buy AA stock for $5. Now AA stock shoots up to $300 by thursday soon to be $1000 on friday.  Johnny is fucked and doesn't have $1000.  Molly is confused as fuck and is afraid she's going to be on the hook for this.  So she halts buying AA, but allows everyone to sell.  That way johnny still buys his short stock before it gets too high that he CAN'T buy it and some off Billy's friends can get some gains.  Because if they let it go to friday, johnny wasn't going to be able to buy AA, therefore NO ONE was going to buy AA and the stock was going to plummet to $5 again as Billy and Co were desperately looking for buyers.

Where am I wrong here?</text>

    <text>I believe it stems from the fact that while there's a lot of useful security analysis that goes on, many decisions and support to invest is based on memes. Also many users apparently gamble and invest their entire savings, children's college funds etc and take out credit card loans which are all incredibly risky to do because you could potentially loose everything in a single trade. ([and people have even lost more than they had at stake to begin with](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/ahbea5/a_user_in_rwallstreetbets_managed_to_lose_5798957)) and they goad each other on to do so.

The mainstream view is that this is not a good idea. They are using it to show the wallstreet boys that they are loosing to 'autists and retards'

It also helps them to cope when they loose out and creates a sense of community.</text>

    <text>I don't understand the concept of borrowing stocks in the first place. There are a lot of replies that explain that stocks are borrowed but that just doesn't make any sense to me. Once you pay someone for them why aren't they your stocks? Why wouldn't they be transferred? Why would someone want to lend them out? Is it the company lending them? Also if there aren't enough stocks since this is all made up stuff in the first place why doesn't the company make more stocks?</text>

I’m brand new to stocks and had a hard time wrapping my head around this.The guy in this video broke it down really well....
It’s really is amazing to me that those responsible for the meltdown in 2008 that destroyed people’s retirements, took away their homes, and inflicted financial misery on so many, are still their sociopathic selves, and won’t acknowledge the consequences of their actions. Reddit seems to have played a big part in knocking them down a peg.</text>

    <text>I know nothing about stocks but why is this not easy to make money on though. . For example, in this situation the price is being artifically inflated at the cost of the hedge funds people buying them knowing that the hedge funds have shorted too many. Too make a profitable decsion surely you would only have too look at the percentage of shorts still in the market i.e how many of the hedge funds have cut there losses. If theres still a big percentage of shorts you buy and wait for the hedge funds to sell. What the flaw here?</text>

    <text>Sorry for not being specific enough. I was essentially just speaking on the ability to lend/receive a loan in that manner, where the actual money you have to pay back is not guaranteed to be even be in the same order of magnitude and on top of that paying interest. It seems dangerous, to me, by nature. But I don’t know jack shit about this stuff I’m just asking questions to learn more.</text>

    <text>It is expected from the little people to invest their money in safe longterm stocks like apple, Amazon or some funds or ETFs.

Bank consultants make you believe that investing in a company like Gamestop is retarded and too risky for the normal John Doe. WSB knows better and throws lots of private money in these stocks, so it came up as a joke. But also to make a fool out of the wall street bankers who would call you retard to hold you back from manipulating and messing with their stocks.</text>

    <text>Of course Melvin has other assets, and it may in fact be able to use those assets as direct collateral for its short position or use them as collateral for a loan to cover its short position. However, the public would not necessarily have any visibility of this because these assets would not necessarily leave Melvin's books.

And, yes, they can simply fold and walk away, although they would lose all the collateral they've provided to their securities lenders so far. It's important to understand that a short position is not some kind of promise to the wider market. Rather, it's a contractual promise to another private investor (in this case, the institution who lent Melvin the shares). Those two parties can agree at any time to terminate their trade for a cash settlement. Melvin can effectively trigger this at any time or likes simply by failing to provide further collateral when demanded, at which point the lender will have to close out the transaction to avoid incurring losses itself. Obviously Melvin wouldn't want to do this because it would make a huge cash loss, but eventually if the share price keeps going up they'll have no choice because they'll run out of collateral.

It is important to understand that, because the short position is a trade between two private investors, they are free to agree to end it any time, and it is not necessary to purchase any shares to do this - Melvin just has to pay the cash it owes to its counterparty. And when that happens, the short position could disappear in the blink of an eye and all of a sudden the GME investors are left holding shares that are basically worthless.</text>

    <text>The shorts don't expire, they can sell them in 10 years if they want to, but during that time they're paying interest on the loaned stocks, so the longer they hang on to them, the more it will cost them. So while there's no expiry date, there comes a point where realistically they have to cut their losses and give them back.</text>

    <text>The thing is, if WSB succeeds, what they'll cause is a massive transfer of wealth from the hedge fund to its share lender, which is probably another hedge fund. So even the guys who think they're sticking it to the man are just helping another part of the man, which is what makes this all so tragic. Of course, those investors who sell before the peak will do very well.</text>

    <text>I guess that’s where I’m confused. If there’s no expiration and just interest charges, can’t they just wait it out and let this bubble to burst? Or do they have to return the stocks if the lender calls and says “hey, give them back now”?

If I’m the lender I want my stocks back NOW, but if I’m the borrower I’m just going to hold onto them in hopes that this bubble bursts sooner or later. I’m wondering a) how long can they wait and b) what happens if that deadline hits and they can’t find any stock to buy? If most of it is owned by people who want to give Wall Street the middle finger not finding any stocks to buy is a good possibility.</text>

    <text>It depends on how they did it. If they just simply borrowed it and sold it, they could theoretically wait indefinitely as long as they could pay the fees and interest associated with borrowing the stock and could ensure they had enough collateral. If they did some other strategies (involving options), there are expiry dates which could force them to buy shares at certain times.

The collateral required is typically tied to the value of the shares in the market now. It goes up as the value of the GME shares goes up, since the liability (gotta buy back those shares) becomes more expensive.</text>

    <text>This. The way I understand it, hedge funds wanted to return, meaning buy and return to the people they borrowed from (say) 100 shares, and had the ability to purchase these shares from the market. However, Reddit realized this, and bought basically all available shares in the market. Making hedge funds unable to purchase 100 shares at any price. The lending people wanted their shares back, and now hedge funds have no idea where to get the shares from, unless they buy them back from angry Redditors who are unwilling to sell at anything but a high price since there is a shortage of a stock in the market.</text>

    <text>Thank you for the explanation! It prompted another question, however:

Aren't these hedgefunds and banks, and the rest of the economy all connected? If Hedgedund X looses money, they cannot repay the bank, or the bank itself has to empty its reserves to pay for it, and now there is less money for the rest of the economy? Like (and yet again, super noob here), won't this mean that the bank now has 70B less to lend to the government that the government can use on I dunno, building roads and hospitals?

Or it's not THAT connected?</text>

    <text>I'm no expert either, but as with many things lately these big events cause one to learn a few things to keep up :)

They took a fairly reasonable position (that gamestop would be decreasing in value due to the direction gaming is going, away from physical disks and whatnot), but they got way too greedy with it by shorting too much.

When you short a stock what you are actually doing is borrowing that stock from someone else and selling it on the market, with the guarantee that you will pay them back that stock in the future.  I think they have to pay interest on that stock to the person they borrowed it from for every day (or some other time period) that they keep it, kind of like interest on a loan.  If you think it will go down in value then it is a good deal, because you can buy it back at a lower price and bank the difference.

How can you short over 100% of available stocks?  By borrowing a borrowed stock.

If you lend me a stock and I sell it on the market then I owe you one stock, but whoever I sold it to is also owed a stock (because they bought it).  If that person goes and lends that stock to another person who sells it on the market, now **three** people are owed a stock (you, the person I sold the borrowed stock to, and the last person who bought the twice-borrowed stock).

Obviously only one real stock exists, so the two additional stocks are IOUs.  Right now the hedge funds and other people who bought shorts are stuck where they owe people the stocks they borrowed, but all of the WSB people are not selling them.  The funds have to pay increasing interest on these borrowed stocks, so every day this continues they are bleeding money, and the value of the stocks keeps going up.

They knew very well that this could happen, and "short squeezes" like this are common when one fund squeezes the other.  The new thing here is that it is ordinary people who are squeezing the funds.  That is why it is so bad that they are bitching about it being "hackers" and other bullshit, because they all know it is perfectly legal and do the same things themselves all the time.</text>

    <text>If they go bankrupt the shares might go to 0. A company can issue new shares to raise capital. Lots of times if a company is struggling they will sell more shares to raise more capital. This would prevent bankruptcy. So if the share price is $300 its unlikely they will go bankrupt.</text>

    <text>Borrowing a stock generally requires paying a fee, so even if you get the stock back lower than you started, it's not necessarily seen as that bad. Especially since borrowing a stock just to short sell it isn't that common.   


As for why haven't competitors done this, the issue is that this involves heavily investing in a company that's commonly believed to be failing. It's not really seen as worth it for most financial institutions, because paying a lot of money into a company that is seen as a failure isn't considered a good move. That's part of why this took people by surprise, because getting a bunch of people to say "Screw that, I'm buying Gamestop anyways!" isn't normal behavior.</text>

Indexed mutual fund with very low fees. “Low fee” is important because those fees have compounding effects over time.

VOO is another one which is an index of the S&amp;P 500. https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/VOO

Vanguard is the company that invented indexed mutual funds.

VOO performs better than VT (last 10 years)

    <text>The GameStop story can make it seem like gambling, but the motivations of investors vary from the very short term to the very long term, and the stock market has proven itself to be a relatively accessible and low-cost way to increase your wealth over the long term (compared, for example, to things like a bar of gold, or a building somewhere that might be more costly to purchase and can't be sold just by making a phone call when you want the cash).</text>

Example: You build a company that helps people get any book they want delivered right to their door. You have had many people give you money to help run this business but to make it even better for your customers, you will need more money. So, you sell part of your company to the public and in return they give you money to spend to give your customers the best book to door delivery service possible.</text>

    <text>So, the basic idea is that people are buying, trading and selling shares, partial ownership in companies. If I am a shareholder in a company, I am a partial owner. I may be eligible to vote in certain major company decisions. If the company is making a lot of money, they may use some of that profit to reward the shareholders.   


But beyond that, yeah, it's pretty much like trading cards, just instead of a Pokemon or a Baseball player, it's a company.</text>

    <text>1. Reddit actually likes the stock. It's got a new CEO ([chewy.com](https://chewy.com) creator), and things are looking bright. Reddit genuinely wants this company to succeed.
2. There is a massive pyramid of shorts on this stock. Wall street was trying to depress this stock to make money and got overzealous and shorted way more than they should have.
3. Combination of 1 and 2 cause reddit to load into GME, because they know that the short positions have to be closed at some point, and GME is a good company.

Sure, you can pump any stock to short squeeze, but the levels will be nowhere near as high as this squeeze because the shorting is of historic proportions with GME. Pumping and dumping is illegal though, and the roots of this entire GME fiasco were rooted in the stock being liked.</text>

    <text>It’s not referring to worth, but shares instead. 
A *lends* B a pie worth $10. B sells the pie to C for $10. C then *lends* it to D. D sells the pie to E. 

Now. Both person B and person E owe a pie. Problem is, there’s only one pie, and a bunch of redditors drove the price of the pie up, so B and E will have to outbid each other to get someone to sell them a pie so their lenders don’t castrate them.</text>

    <text>No, you are borrowing the stock when it’s $100 so you can immediately sell it for $100. If you are smart and the stock eventually dips to $50, you buy it back to give it back to the lender and you close out your short position with a $50 profit, minus the interest and fees you pay for borrowing the share. Basically these guys got extra greedy and went back to the guy they sold the stock at $100 from and borrowed that stock again so they could sell it again to someone else for another $100. Now they have to buy two shares in the future to payback their lenders.</text>

    <text>Well, this particular trick only worked because the large investors were doing a risky maneuver involving borrowing stocks, selling them, then rebuying them at a lower cost. It is very likely that trick is going to be retired in the immediate future by large investors now that they know that regular folks figured out how to exploit it.</text>

    <text>What is the reasoning behind B selling the stock at 60% off?

B sells the stock to C for $100. C then lends out the stock to D, who again sells the stock for $100. 

Let’s say this single stock was the only one that existed for this company, instead of there being 10 million shares or whatever. Based on only 1 share existing, 2 have been loaned out. This means that the stock has been shorted 200%.</text>

    <text>Your math is broken and the math itself is more of a gamble then an accuracy. You're betting that the value of the bet itself will change. Clear right?

If stock a is normal $100, then to buy 10 stocks would cost $1000. However, I could buy a call option giving me exposure to those 10 shares at a much lower price (say $200). And if the stock exceed the $100 I get everything over that. However, if it falls short, it will decline in value or expire worthless, giving you a 100% loss.

Expire is a key word. Options typically expire on the last day of the trading month.</text>

    <text>Billy think a $100 stock is probably going to fall in price. Billy asks Amy, "Can I borrow that stock from you? I'll give it back later." Amy agrees and lends a stock to Billy, who then sells it at $100 to Charlie. Billy is hoping that the stock can be repurchased more cheaply at $80, which means he'll make a $20 profit when he returns the stock to Amy

Darryl also thinks the stock will fall in price. Darryl asks Charlie, "hey I borrow your share? I'll give it back later." Charlie agrees and lends the stock to Darryl, who then sells it for $100 to Eva.

At this point, there are three people who have a long position, aka they own the stock: Amy, Charlie, and Eva. There are two people with short positions, Billy and Darryl, aka they borrowed the stock with promises to return it later. However, it's still the one share.

It's similar to how fractional reserve banking works. Bank A can lend out its deposits, which becomes deposits at bank B, and so forth.</text>

    <text>&gt;A hedge fund's purpose is to maximize investor returns and eliminate risk. 

But over time, fewer and fewer hedge funds actually spent as much time eliminating risk as they have trying to maximize returns. These days, most hedge funds are

&gt; just a fancy name for an investment partnership that has freer rein to invest aggressively and in a wider variety of financial products than most mutual funds.

    <text>I want to sell a bunch of ExampleCo stock. I think ExampleCo is doing poorly, and that I can use that to my advantage. I don't own a lot of ExampleCo stock. So I find people who have it, and pay them a small fee to let me borrow their ExampleCo stock so I have enough for my plan.   


Now that I have a lot of that stock, I sell it all. Part of this plan is selling a lot all at once, because that scares other investors and makes them worried. "Is something wrong with ExampleCo? That guy sold a TON of stock at once. I bet something is wrong. I'll sell all of mine too." Now the price of ExampleCo has dropped even more than before.   


But, I did borrow a bunch of it, so I do have to buy it back. But now it's a lot cheaper, so I make money on this deal.</text>

    <text>Near term? Nothing.

Long term? They get to maybe remain open after this. If the shorts had run their course, GameStop may have entered a downward spiral- unable to borrow to make changes, forcing their stock down even further. The stock won’t stay at these insane levels forever, but they may settle higher than the $4 they were trading at in the summer.</text>

    <text>Is there evidence (other than the GME/Robin hood-case which is ofcourse to recent for there to be any research done yet) that market manipulation by "big money"/hedge funds/big investors actually happens?

Edit:  I phrased myself poorly, I was specificly looking for cases of market  manipulation where big money had manipulated the price of a stock *LIKE* in the GME-case. Essentially what I want to know is if this is as commonplace that it happens and goes unpunished by "big money" as some friends want me to believe.</text>

    <text>Either they sell at a peak, or let it stabilize and see what they have at the end. Folks that bought early will probably profit either way, just not as much as those that sell, but folks who came in late at $300+ might see quite a loss. Thats the risk in buying a volatile stock.</text>

    <text>1. Yes, you're right. Wsb didn't cause it, amplified it at best. The ridiculous extent of short selling is the main factor.

2. It's mostly a). I mean we're still in January and GME price is already 12x YTD, and that's after yesterday's drop. It was even higher the day before. This in less than 20 trading sessions.

3. It's not common for short sellers to do something like this.  Usually brokers are responsible for ensuring there is availability of stocks before allowing a short. But hedge funds have been known to mislead their brokers. How it works is, for instance, Melvin can buy 100 shares. Then call it's 4 prime brokers and ask to short 100 shares. It'll show its ownership of 100 shares to reassure them it can cover with it's own shares even if they were not able to buy from the market in the worst case scenario. But the brokers work independently so don't know Melvin has said the same to the others. So Melvin can short 400 shares while only being able to cover 100. This is actually illegal but SEC rarely enforces it.

Also, it would've come back to bite them even if reddit wasn't involved. Reddit just tightened the screws by further restricting the supply of shares.

4. There will be no impact on the underlying business of GME. If there are any regulatory changes because of this, it'd affect the broader market participants, but I personally don't think anything will change. At best, Melvin will probably go bankrupt and brokers will get a slap on the wrist for restricting trades. But we'll have to see what happens.</text>

I guess the company lets the borrower do it in the hopes they get some profit out of an incorrect guess that the value would decline?

Also...no other company has ever bought up stocks so a competitor who did a short sell would be screwed?</text>

    <text>Theoretically, yes, but that's the gamble you and the short seller are taking. It's kind of like asking why you would sell your stock at $100 - surely the person willing to buy your stock is just looking for it to go up and then sell it at $105 or whatever, so why not hold onto it? There's an expectations and risk model that every trader has(knowingly or unknowingly), and they decide on what to trade.

If you are holding on to your long position in the long term, short-term changes to the market are immaterial to you. A lot of the trading volume happens on a daily basis, chasing local ups and downs, so you don't really mind someone borrowing your stock to realize(potentially risky) daily gains - the short seller is the one taking the risk, and you're gaining a little bit of money out of it.

But this isn't even the full picture - the people holding long-term long positions are not necessarily the ones doing the lending. As far as I know, most of the stocks that are shorted are lended by brokers(the intermediary between traders and the exchange), and they might use inventory from their clients or their own inventory to lend. If the actual client tries to sell stock that was lended by the broker, it's up to that broker to either replace the share from their own inventory or buy new shares to cover it.</text>

    <text>There are mock stock trading simulators out there, you can google that. You can practice trading stocks for free and watch your portfolio of mock stock purchases go up and down. That's a first step.

Once you've gained a little bit of comfort with that, you can open up an account in any of dozens of brokerages. Be on the lookout for account and trade fees, but most don't have them. Robinhood was extremely popular up until their fiasco today, now they are one of the enemies. If you have a bank account, many of them are associated with brokerages that can make it easier on you to start investing (TD Bank -&gt; TD Ameritrade, Bank of America -&gt; Merrill Lynch).

Don't invest more than you can afford to lose. Start off with $20 or $100 and go for a couple tiny stocks. See what happens. When you are more comfortable, you can put more money into your account.</text>

    <text>&gt; Like does Apple buy back it's own stocks, and sell it back if it anticipates that their price will go up?

Yes. Stock buy-backs are a strategy, but it's risky. In order to buy stock, you have to have money to pay for it, right?

Rhyno's Widgets is doing well and I have like, $10,000 worth of cash sitting in the bank. I'm tired of giving away my profits so I'll make the same decision that investors made: I'll buy the stock for cash *now* so that I can make more money *later* (or in this case, I can *keep* more money later, which amounts to the same thing). So I spend all of my $10,000 and buy back as much stock as I can.

But, oh no! A critical piece of machinery in my widget maker broke, and I can't make more widgets until I replace that part. And that part costs $10,000. If only I had some cash! Oops. In order to get cash I'll have to sell the stocks again. But, since my company hasn't sold any widgets since the part broke, people are catching on that something is wrong. Either they think there's a problem and my company will lose money, or they know that I need money and will be desperate to sell. Either way, the stock price goes down, and I have to sell more stocks than I just bought in order to get the $10k I need.

Ultimately, I lost money because I bought stocks when they were expensive and had to sell them when they were cheaper. Companies will always have some amount of cash reserves for an emergency. Buying stocks back will deplete the reserves but increase profit. Might be worth it, might not be.</text>

    <text>Yes, but again as most stockholders hold only a small fraction of ownership their votes probably won't matter compared to the relatively small group of people who own large, controlling shares.

It's also possible for stock to be "nonvoting" and you don't get to vote at all.</text>

    <text>&gt; Also, what stops a company from manipulating their own value downward (say by having terrible - but controled - results for a while) , then buying back their own stocks for cheap, getting good results for a while after then selling their stocks back for a profit?

That's market manipulation and it's super illegal. So, the answer is: the law, and the consequences that come with breaking it (which can include fines, losing control of the company, and prison time).

&gt; Once a company's owner has sold say 49.9% of his ownership, can he actually sell more stocks to get cash (assuming he wants to keep his 50.1%) ? 

The owner can't both sell shares and keep ownership that those shares represent. The owner can sell to an increasingly narrow margin (50.1%...50.01%...50.001%), though. To do this, shares can be split: each share becomes two shares (or five shares, or ten shares). If someone already owns one share, after the split they'll own two shares (or five shares, etc.).

The founder owns 5001 of the 10,000 shares, giving them 50.01% ownership. Split the stock, now there's 20,000 shares and the founder owns 10,002 of them, and can sell one share and still have a majority of 50.005%.

Splitting the stock will influence stock prices, though, and may cause them to go down so the founder will get less for that one share they can sell.

Or they can sell more than 50% of the ownership and just deal with it. If, for example, they own 49.9% of the ownership it's unlikely that *every single stockholder* will vote against them, which means they still have nominal control. It's not impossible, though, especially if it's a small company with not a lot of stocks. Or if someone with enough money to buy all of the other shares does so, and thus gets &lt;50% ownership.</text>

    <text>You have to specifically call your broker to not let this happen, which for most people isn't worth the effort. Since the shares are SIPC insured, just like the money in a bank is FDIC insured, you don't really care usually.</text>

    <text>Yes, that's what short selling is. You are betting on a stock to go down so you borrow shares to sell, with the promise of buying them back at a later date (hopefully for you, a lower price). The reason buying volume was very low yesterday is because numerous brokers actually turned off the ability to buy GME. This is unprecedented, has never happened before, and is resulting in lawsuits and investigations.</text>

    <text>Well the share was $5 over the summer and when all of this is said and done, the price will probably be close to it, BUT without all that short volume, so lets say $20. So yes, it will be better for GME, their stock and ability to raise capital will likely go up.</text>

    <text>This moment is likely too short for them to capitalize on it. For insiders to sell, they have to fill out forms weeks in advance and for the company to raise capital, the only real move they can do is sell shares held, which they probably aren't holding onto that many. Everyone who is long GME has an interest in the shorts getting burned as hard as possible</text>

    <text>Really complicated question.

Call options - you are making an agreement with someone to buy 100 shares at a given price at a given time. Someone will 'write' that option for you. DFV was buying options really far into the future and someone wrote them thinking it would be be worth less at that date in the future. As you can see, it was not.

I'm going to guess he say the fundamentals in GME changed (they did) or he say the high short volume (it was). Things got really bad this week, but I'm not sure why shit hit the fan because usually every time Citron does this shit it works. This is the first time I've really seen it not work.</text>

    <text>An option is an agreement that allows you to buy/sell a share at a specific amount.

For DFV, he saw the price that GME was trading for, realized it is likely that it will be trading much higher (not based on shorts but based on its value as a company) and bought agreements (options contracts) that allows him to buy GME in the future for a specific price (lower than what he expects it to be).

Eg.  let's say GME is trading at $6 on Jan 1, and I think it will be trading at $20 on march 1. I pay $1 for the option to be able to buy GME for $10 on march 1.  If it is over $10, I buy for $10, then sell for whatever price it is.  If it's not over $10, I'm down my $1.</text>

    <text>So think of a basic supply and demand concept. As supply goes down and demand goes up price goes up. So what is going to happen is the Hedge funds who are short GME will have to cover, meaning they will have to give back the stock they borrowed. When they do that they will have to buy massive volumes of stock forcing the price even higher. There will then be a sell off from the public which will make the people who bought stock money and the price will fall as they sell but the idea is to be out of it by then.</text>

    <text>Partial ownership of the company. A company will sell shares to a bank to raise revenue for its activities. The bank sells the shares to investors on a stock exchange. Then investors trade them with each other. The company does not receive funds from these trades, but a high share price may allow them to get more money from a bank later if they choose to release more shares.</text>

    <text>On average shorting stocks will reduce volatility and improve efficiency.

If you think back to the dot com bubble a lot of the new internet stocks didn’t have shares available to short sellers and the ones that did charged extreme interest. that let valuations get out of hand. A company called 3Com sold shares in its cellphone subsidiary. Shares of 3com could be converted into the cellphone shares at a ratio of 2/3 but because of the mania the cellphone shares exceeded the shares of 3com itself. If shares were available to short you could go long 3com and short the cell company for virtually riskless profit.</text>

    <text>Normally to you gain some money, you need buy some stock and sell later with profit when the price is higher and you can lose it when the price goes down.  
When you Short a stock, you can swap the rules of the game, you will gain money with the price goes down and lose money when goes up.  
This possible borrowing stocks, selling immediately and buying after to make the profit.  


Short squeeze is pressure on the buying side, the price goes up and the people with short positions needs buy stocks to cancel it. Additionally, there was a buying pressure from the holders of the stock (today case was wallstreetbet ppl)  


usually those who have a short position also start appearances in the media to try to make the price drop with their pessimistic opinions, making money from it. Manipulating the price.</text>

    <text>I'm not an expert. In fact, i just started learning about this because of the GME, but I believe the short answer is yes. It's called securities lending, and usually pays dividends to the owner.

    <text>Virtually anyone with a brokerage can sell short. Hedge funds tend to short more than normal investors because many of them promise that to their investors. Initially hedge funds were meant to be hedged (hence the name) to the market. The idea was that if professional investor go long some assets and short others they should be able to produce good returns that are independent of the market. Historically hedge funds haven’t actually lived up to those expectations and the term has expanded to cover many different investment strategies.</text>

If their stock price is $1000 or if it's $1, they will still have the same capital (stores, products, etc), revenue, workers, etc. and will go on their way to continue building their business.

One thing that could make them happy is if they do a share offering where they sell more of their company to the public.</text>

    <text>Apart from the initial capital a company could do a secondary offering and gain even more capital. A higher trading volume generally suggest a “more accurate” valuation. It is like if you were to buy toilet paper at the beginning of the coronavirus there a good chance someone could rip you off but during normal times you can be confident that whatever you are buying is an okay price. 

Additionally many employees and owners will have compensation packages that allow them to benefit from an increase in valuation. This means you could reward yourself and your employees without increasing cash expenses.</text>

    <text>Right, once the have done an offering, the company does not get impacted by your trade with someone else in the market.

It doesn't help, it doesn't hurt.

If it goes really high, the might do another offering and sell more of their company at the new price.</text>

    <text>Let's say the stock is $20, and I want to short 1 million shares. I will need to show I have $20 million in cash in my account and will then be able to open that position. Now 2 days later that same stock is $100 and my brokerage wants to see $100 million instead. If I don't have that money, my brokerage will turn my other assets in my account to cash to cover and close the position. This is why wsb is trying to get to happen to Melvin and Citron. It's possible to push the share value so high that pretty much every short doesn't have the capital to pay for their short position and their brokerage liquidates them.</text>

    <text>In general, when they are borrowing stocks from other investors, it's treated like a loan. They are paying a small fee to borrow them at all, and if they don't pay back in time, they will owe additional money, being charged interest on that loan. So if they don't pay it back on time, they'll owe even more money.</text>

    <text>These are call derivatives. Look at the columns in the picture. There’s a bid and an ask column. Bid is what people are willing to pay for that particular contract and ask is what people want for them. When someone bids what someone wants, a sale gets placed. The bid-ask gap in the first option is about $0.50 which is pretty big. Usually a big gap also indicates less people overall trading that particular contract</text>

    <text>By holding longer, the interest on the short becomes overwhelming and the hedge funds scramble to find stocks to repay. Interest on shorts at that volume is backbreaking. Normally shorters can find stocks to buy because there are plenty of liquid stocks available. At the moment, there aren't, and ALOT of people are holding on because it's a golden ticket.</text>

Which is illegal for sure, but also means they have to buy 140% of the stock back. The only way they were going to make money, is by having the stock price fall. That's what they were betting on.

    <text>Because the shares don't actually change hands.  They are done by contracts that are settled based on what would have happened if the shares had been traded based on the price.

This system (like a lot of the financial system) works great as long as things keep rolling along as planned, but crashes and burns when things go awry.

The very deregulation that allowed these derivative markets to become giant casinos is what has allowed it to go so wrong here.</text>

    <text>Shorting is when you borrow shares, then resell, then hope to buy back at a cheaper price.

If you borrow shares, then resell, whoever you sold it to can loan out shares to someone else trying to short as well.  If there was only one share available in this example, it would be 200% shorted at this point.</text>

The massive short was a castle made of sand and it took a tide of tiny traders cooperating on a scale that rivals a hedgefund to set this in motion but a second hedge could have easily done it instead if they weren't concerned that the first hedge would turn around and wreck a castle of sand belonging to the second hedge.</text>

    <text>not that common, I'm still confused how selling devalues the share and buying increases the share when both actions have to happen simultaneously. is the company being traded under an obligation to buy a stock back on demand and all buys and sells come to and from the OG company or is this purely selling and buying trader to trader, and how did they ever get into a situation where there's 140% of the total shares in the wild. i may need to let go of the idea of tangible goods cause 10 oranges ain't 14 oranges no matter how many times I pass them between me and someone else</text>

Not illegal as far as I know, but there is talk of investigation and both AOC and Ted Cruz have tweeted about it being unfair, so if both left and right politicians agree it's possible something will come of it!

Unfair - depends on your standpoint. It was technically still possible to buy the shares, just on other platforms (which were often harder to use than the ones that closed). It does scream manipulation of some kind to me, but where law and the financial market is concerned I am very very far from an expert!</text>

    <text>Well, the penalty for doing something like that is usually a large fine (fee), and maybe a company gets shut down.

I'm guessing that the hedge funds did the math:

(the fine for illegal activity) is less than  (the amount of money they would lose).

So, a company (Robinhood probably) will be sacrificed, and maybe $50 million in fines. That's better than losing billions of dollars.

But, it backfired (had the opposite effect), because it pissed people off and inspired a bunch of people to buy more GME, just to hurt the hedge funds more.</text>

It could well be that these trading companies have special products with other criteria unaccessible for us.</text>

    <text>Someone who has 100 shares of the stock you purchased a CALL option for might want to cash out when the stock hits the desired price which is +$10. So example, I own 100 shares of the stock and I am happy to sell when the stock hits $110. I can sell a Call option on that stock. The reason I would do that is I will earn premium by selling the CALL option and if the stock does not go to $110 by the expiration date, I get to keep the premium.</text>

    <text>The option will generally be for 100 shares of whatever company, but the option itself will cost usually a small percentage of the total value of those 100 shares, so you could with a $10 option have the right to buy for example, 100 shares of gamestop at $40(last week's price), and you could now sell them at $300 for a nice profit all without having to have risked $4000 from buying the 100 shares</text>

    <text>Professional investors can use it to cover for their own obligations. 

Say a grain trader has a contract with farmers to receive a fixed amount of grain for $1 million in August. In May, he starts getting worried that the grain price might drop and he will not be able to resell the grain without taking a loss. So he finds somebody who agrees to give him the option to sell the grain to him for $1 million. 

If the market price is above $1 million in August, the grain trader is free to sell on the market for a profit - selling for $1 million is just an option, not an obligation. If it drops below, he can sell immediately for $1 million, negating his losses. 

Because this would be unfair otherwise, the person selling the option will get a fixed amount of money for selling the option, regardless of whether it is used in the end. 

Or it’s just used for betting on the market.</text>

    <text>1. Wait, so regardless of how long this daisychain of people involved gets... let's say Doug borrows and sells those shares to Mike Tyson. Yes, Doug is contractually obligated to return those shares... but Mike isn't, right? Mike could just be some regular guy who now owns some shares? What if Mike decides he doesn't want to sell them back, not for any reason in the world? Couldn't even one circumstance like that (or even hundreds of weird Mike Tysons at the end of these chains) cause some insane problems all the way up the line?
2. In order to prevent situations were "200 shares worth of short positions based on 100 shares of stock" even occur, why isn't there a limit that says shares can only be borrowed and sold one time? Wouldn't this magically prevent any situation like having 140% of shares shorted?</text>

    <text>They can sit on their short position as long as they want, as long as they are paying interest and have a certain % of their shorts value up as collateral (I like to think of it as rent for borrowing the stock, and the bond you pay to rent a house). At the price gme was, the rent was barely dollars. Right now the rent is way higher because the value is higher. Idk why tbh but the interest is connected to the stock price.

If it dropped low enough....say to 0 for example... That's when they buy back out of their short and essentially just double the money they put in minus a few dollars of interest.

There would have been plenty of stock to buy if it dropped like that. Since it tends to drop BECAUSE nobody wants to buy it.

So nah. They sort of just buy out bits at a time. And if gme collapses, they just brush their hands and walk away (I think. I'm not a lawyer for insolvency in any way lol)</text>

    <text>I haven’t followed this situation super closely. I understand that people believe that this Friday is a key day. It’s hard to say because the exact timing depends on what exactly the trade is that the hedge funds put on. 

There are multiple ways to take a short position and some of them are more time sensitive than others. In a classic short sale the issue is that you are paying interest on your loan. As long as you could fund that, I guess you could hold out indefinitely. But if you have used options, those have expiry dates and could potentially create deadlines.</text>

So they would need to be able to show that they had planned on selling on this date for this reason(raising funds for store improvements, etc).

    <text>Well, the people who borrowed the stock generally have to pay a fee to do so.   


Likewise, in most of these cases, they aren't borrowing from individuals, but from large funds that have hundreds or thousands of stocks that they're watching over, and so getting one stock back at a lower rather than it was loaned at isn't seen as that big of a deal, because if you're loaning out a lot of stocks, some are bound to come back lower than before. But yes, if this was an individual, they'd be way more likely to notice and get pissed that what they loaned out lost a ton of value.</text>

    <text>At some point the hedge funds that shorted the stock will have to close their positions. This means buying stock. With their current short position, they don’t currently own any stock, but they sold stock a long time ago. They had hoped they would be able to buy that stock later for less than they sold it. However, retail investors have made that impossible. So they have to buy the stock for more than they paid. Because people are so unwilling to sell, the price goes up. To be clear, this is a gamble, not an investment. At some point, when the hedge fund buying starts happening, people will want to get out of their positions and a great sell off will happen. The stock will come crashing down. Some will make a lot of money and some will lose some money. Mostly though, the hedge funds will have lost a bunch of money and everyone is happy about that. This is because the hedge fund is made up of 0.01%er’s money.  Also to note, time is on our side, because the hedge fund has to pay interest to borrow those shares they sold but didn’t own. Also the brokerage can force them to close their position when it looks like the loss will be more than the hedge fund can handle. A large one (Melvin) has already taken a large loan to bolster their cash position to delay this. But I think they burned through it already. It’s actually unclear to me if Melvin closed out their position by now or not. Lol. I’ve seen conflicting reports.</text>

    <text>If I understand correctly, at a basic level they get a payout. Let's say a stock is worth 5 bucks and you're betting it'll drop to 2. If you pay me 1 for borrowing the stock, I take on no risk but I still have the stock (eventually) and also make a dollar, while you might profit 2 (5 minus the 1 you gave me and the 2 you bought it back for) if you're right, but take on risk. I assume the amount I charge to borrow my stock can be a flat fee or a percentage of something but I don't know that for sure.</text>

    <text>To add to the answers you've already gotten, it hedges your position. If I offer you a dollar to borrow your $10 share of XYZ stock and the stock drops to $7, then I made $2 but you only lost $2 instead of $3. And if the stock stays the same value, or goes up, then you make money on the exchange. If you own a stock, you probably have at least some expectation that it will be going up, so why not leverage your ownership of that stock for some extra money? And if an extreme situation like this arises where you likely won't get your share back, then you're entitled to some collateral of mine that I put up when I borrowed the share.</text>

    <text>Not all GameStop stocks are owned by Redditors who are refusing to sell. Some were owned by regular investors, who buy sell and trade stocks normally. So the folks who were just regular shareholders who got caught up in this are still willing to benefit from the higher price due to the increased demand and to sell the ones they still have. BUT, there's not enough of them to cover all of the hedge funds who borrowed so many shares, so that's not really a perfect solution.</text>

    <text>Companies issue X number of stocks as a fractional percentage of their company.For example, if I issue out 10,000 stocks of my company XY, and you buy one of them, you own 1/10,000th of my company.

Companies cannot just issue out new stock willy nilly, generally that requires a lot of paperwork and approval time. It also usually lowers the price of the stocks currently on the market, which companies usually don't want.

This also bleeds into something that you might have been hearing about before, which is companies using profits to do stock buybacks, where they buy stocks back into their own ownership, as opposed to letting the public own it, thus increasing the value of individual stocks. This is generally seen as a waste of profits, as opposed to investing it in R&amp;D or expansion, as it doesn't make the company any more productive. It however, does make large shareholders of companies that do buybacks very happy, as the shares they hold are now worth more.</text>

Who decides that point? 

If the person short selling decides, they can just wait for this to blow over right?   
If it's the person who lend the stock out, what are the restrictions, is there a specific date set in the short sell contract? Can they just ask it back whenever?

    <text>After the squeeze there’s always an epic crash but who knows where the price will settle. A lot of people (and probably institutions) got in GME not because of the shorts but because of new CEO getting on board and they’re planning on holding onto their shares in the long run. So there’s a possibility the stock will settle higher than before this meteoric rise or at least I doubt it will fall back under 10$.</text>

There is no such "guarantee".  There was a very strong possibility, but no guarantee.  The people holding game stop are in a risky position. The people holding out for the highest return are going to be left with a seriously over-valued and rapidly-declining stock price.</text>

He apparently sold some earlier this week for about 14 million and has around 25 million in stock left. While they had to have some cash to be able to make that initial investment, the gamble has massively paid off 🙂</text>

    <text>Kinda, sorta yes, but mostly no. The buyer receives the shares immediately, and you receive the money immediately.  You effectively have a negative number of shares. 

Those shares didn't just materialize out of thin air.  You borrowed them from your broker. The same broker that holds your entire investment portfolio. And he wants them back. He has the right to take as much of your investment portfolio as it takes for him  to re-acquire his shares. And then send you a bill for the remainder.</text>

    <text>But why would the broker let you borrow the shares if they're going to be returned when the price has crashed? Why wouldn't the broker want to preserve the value of their portfolio and not lend it out to be wrecked? 

Are the fees charged for the loan that high it offsets the loss in value?

I get the mechanics of short-selling but the logic eludes me.</text>

    <text>What retail investors are doing right now is **not illegal**, literally anyone could look up $GME and see that it's shorted by over 120%. Hedgefunds like Melvin Capital and Citadel forcing brokers to barr regular people from buying a stock is **illegal**. Off to r/HailCorporate you go.</text>

    <text>So this is super variable, two factors, the time you buy and the time you sell and the price at both times.

So the cheapest way would be say if you bought back in August the price was around 5 bucks. Today in pre market trading we saw prices of around 500 for a short period and if you timed your buy and sell perfectly you would have a 100x return on investment. So to get to 1 million today you would have to own 2,000 shares, if you bought those for 5 bucks each you’d have spent 10k.

The same maths works anywhere along the chart, so if you bought at 50 and sold at 100 you would have needed to buy 10,000 shares at a cost of 500,000 dollars.

This is purely based on just buying stock, if you used options it could be different.</text>

    <text>This is not a pump and dump. That would require the perpetrators to lie to the public. WSB exposed the truth - hedges were overly greedy and vulnerable.

Since then WSB has been flooded with bots using farmed accounts dumping thousands of (often misleading) posts a minute. Would not be surprised at all if the hedges were funding that attack.</text>

So if there is good news about a company then more people want to buy the stock and price goes up and bad news means more people sell so price goes down

    <text>Even if someone would buy it at $50, they would buy it at any cheaper price. As long as someone is offering it cheaper than yours, those will be bought before yours are.

A lot of people have strategies where they will sell their shares in a stock once it reaches a certain price (i.e., all the shares people are willing to sell for cheaper have been sold), and those will be listed to be sold at that price.</text>

    <text>A broker is the one who loans shares.  If the broker is never paid back they are in a bad position.  Sort of like if you own a home and you stop paying your mortgage, the bank that loaned you money is in a bad position.  This is why brokers, like mortgage lenders, require some sort of margin/collateral.  It’s also why brokers reserve the right to issue a margin call if they think you’re in jeopardy of not being able to cover and they will take a loss</text>

    <text>Okay. I understand this. You just need to promise to sell someone a share at a certain price at some point in the future. I presume it's like the futures market.

But surely if I lend you 100 shares, and buy them off you, I can lend you 100 shares again. I just don't know why I'd want to do that, or promise to buy stock in the future.</text>

    <text>Probably not because all these big hedgefunds have the money to pay people off and control the narrative and point blame at someone. They will probably scapegoat someone in their office and fire him and ban him from the financial sector but he will get a pleasant parting gift of some large lump sum of money for taking the fall. This has happened before and no one has gone to prison because the government hasn't put strict enough precautions to prevent this. This is why GME is booming because we are all using it as an example to prove that the 1% shouldn't be allowed to manipulate the market and get away with it, and it is time for us to prove a point at the same time make sure the government does something about it or it will just happen again and again.</text>

    <text>BTW: this is just a typical bubble. WSB people WILL eventually sell.

Nobody’s going to lock away their life investments for a year without good reason, especially for an unstable stock like GME.

When people sell GME again, the bubble collapses. I’d say it will happen within a month. You can shortsell if you want right now, and then buy the loaned stock like a month or three from now.

    <text>&gt; What happens to B if no one wants to sell their stock? 

Then the stock price goes to infinity.

&gt; I know it's an unlikely scenario

That's pretty much what's happening.  Greed will kick in at some point and prevent it from going to infinity.  

Or B will be unable to pay their debts, all their positions will be liquidated to cover their really large debt to A and C, and the demand created by B needing to buy goes away, and the stock price eventually drops.

This is logically what should happen -- B goes tits up, A and C split all the money B had.  But that doesn't mean that's what *will* happen.</text>

    <text>I think you may be confusing 100k call options with shares to be traded. Remember that options contract units are 100 shares per unit. So if 100k call options expire today, then that would be 10 million shares being traded (assuming the calls were naked and not hedged). That’s around 20% of the GME stock available for trade on the open market. Yesterday the trade volume was only around 60 million shares traded so a gamma squeeze can be pretty significant, but nothing like a short squeeze, though they contribute greatly to them.</text>

    <text>Puts is a similar idea to calls but in reverse. 

Lets say GME was trading at $100 a share. If I thought the stock price was going to drop I would place a put order. Like calls this has an expiry date. I might put 100 GME shares that would be worth $10,000 and I can "borrow" these stocks from the broker and sell them. Once the price drops e.g. to $50 (as long as it is before expiration) I could buy back 100 shares for $5000, return them to the broker (since I borrowed them), pay the broker their fee and I just made $5,000 profit (minus the fee)

The risk here is that if the price goes up (or even stays the same) you can lose a lot of money. If it gets to expiration date and the price is now at $5000 you still need to buy them to return the borrowed stock to your broker and pay their fee which will cost you $500,000. This is what will happen to the hedge funds tomorrow, they placed a put expecting the price to drop down to $2 (random example number) but now its up to $200. They will have to buy all the stock they borrowed at 100x the price they were expecting.

A lot of these puts will probably expire Friday. This is why it is going to be crazy. The price might drop to $50 or skyrocket or both but we are still in the early stage of the squeeze. The real effects will show next week.

This isnt financial advice im an idiot. If I said anything false or confusing plz call me out and I will edit.</text>

They bought stock that rich investors made bets that it would go down. They then lost those bets.

The writer of the option contract (called a Market Maker - who you are buying the contract from) will acquire some of the stock when they write the contract to hold as a reserve (called a hedge) in case the contract is exercised. How much stock they secure uses some fancy math based on the length of the contract, what the strike price is (the price you can but the stock for at the end of the contract) and some other stuff. An options contract is for 100 shares so a Market Maker might buy 20 shares to hold at the time they sell the contract. Let's say as time goes by and the contract gets closer to expiring, its looking like the contract will be in the money - that is the actual stock price is higher then the strike price of the contract. The Market Maker will start buying more stock to increase the reserve. By the day of expiration the Market Maker might only need to buy 10 shares of the 100 they'll owe you to make good on the contract. With GameStop right now there are so many contracts "in the money" the Market Makers have to buy way more stock to cover the contracts then usual - the Gamma Squeeze. They won't be buying the full 100 shares per contract though.</text>

I’m curious to know why hedge funds are so bad, or where does this rep come from. I’m also assuming because they have so much $ they have a pull when it comes to the stock market?</text>

    <text>There is no specific date that shorts expire or must cover. However, shorts pay a daily fee (based on the stock value at end of trading day) to the broker who they borrowed the stock from. Those fees are typically very small. Though, as the value of the loaned asset increases so does the fee as a hedge against you failing to cover your position the broker makes you pay upkeep to keep it open. A gamma squeeze usually results in a large price jump, and ends up making the shorters fees higher. They can of course just pay those higher fees, unless.... the broker gets so anxious about being left unpaid they immediately ask the shorter to return the borrowed stock. That's called being 'margin called', in that event the shorter has no choice but to immediately return the share at any cost, you guessed it, further driving the price up. In the event of GME where the available stocks is fewer than the shorted stocks, this in theory means you can have shorts who cannot cover, which drives the price up infinitely high. In reality, people will sell as the price reaches higher values, but in theory it could raise infinitely, thus infinity squeeze, and why everyone rallies around the 💎✋ emojis. That means hold your stocks, don't sell.</text>

1) how are the euros trading on GME after the US market closes? Is GME listed on the German market as well as the us (eg dual listed?), I'm in Aussie and can only buy when the US market is open so I don't quite get it!
2) What happens if the original owner of a shorted stock wants to sell the stock before the shorter has returned it?</text>

    <text>They didn’t invest in GameStop (GME), they shorted it. This is when you borrow stock off someone else, and sell it immediately, hoping at some point the stock price will drop so you can buy it back and return it to the original owner, pocketing the difference.

Melvin capital shorted 140% of the total shares of GameStop (unbelievably stupid), betting they would go bankrupt.

Take note: Melvin capital did not take profits when GME went down to $4 a share. They WANTED the company to go bankrupt and 15,000 employees to lose their jobs, all so they could line their fat pockets with just a bit more money. Scum.</text>

You decided you didn’t want to play on it, you wanted to make a bit of money, so you sell it to someone *for $500 (you don’t keep it long)*

Then your friend wants to play on it and you’re like, okay, I can buy a new one at Walmart for $400 now. So you buy the new one for $400, give that back to the friend, and pocket the $100 difference - you gained.

You are not waiting to sell the PlayStation until $400, you’re waiting to buy it back then.</text>

I could understand that some companies simply have a portfolio of shares they're hanging on to with some algorithm to sell them, but they'll only be a portion of the market. How are the hedge funds borrowing more than 100% of the company? Surely that means someone is buying shares, purely in order to lend them to someone who fully expects them to lose value.</text>

    <text>&gt; Excuse my ignorance, but could someone write a program to find these instances of there being stocks overborrowed for shorting, then repeat this GME hivemind buying every couple of months?

Get enough people behind it, maybe? For example: apparently if enough people get together and get excited enough about something they apparently can break in to the US Capitol building. 

Real talk: I would imagine that data availability is part of the “why not“. So-called “short interest” is apparently only calculated once or twice a month:

&gt; Most stock exchanges track the short interest in each stock and issue reports at month's end, although Nasdaq is among those reporting twice monthly. -https://www.investopedia.com/articles/01/082201.asp

&gt; these instances 

I only loosely follow the markets, so I don’t know for sure, but it seems that instances of this magnitude aren’t super common. Which leads to your next question:

&gt; How rare is it for a failing company to be shorted so egregiously?

I don’t know. But I do recall reading recently that it happened to Volkswagen once?

Edit: I found some articles on the Volkswagen squeeze that seem pretty decent:

https://moxreports.com/vw-infinity-squeeze/

https://www.autoweek.com/news/industry-news/a35340727/heres-how-the-gamestop-short-squeeze-is-like-the-vw-squeeze-of-2008/

Overall, it seems to me that this is uncommon. It seems to be a combination of things happening without explicit planning among the parties involved, so there’s an element of dumb luck. 

It seems like something like this happens when A) many big institutions decide to short a stock, B) and— surprise, surprise—find out that they *all* shorted the stock, and C) meanwhile, some people or some group or some entity is buying the stock at the same time and won’t sell it cheap.</text>

    <text>Most of this is correct but the beauty of what is happening is some of these big funds won't have a choice in whether they buy the stock back or not. After a certain point they will be forced to buy the shares at whatever price they are being offered for. Once that happens the squeeze will have been squoze. Hopefully it will mostly be the large funds stuck holding the bags on this trade but I'm sure some smaller investors will get stuck with it as well.

    <text>They didn't invest in the company, they bet on them failing. 

The basic idea (simplified, of course) is: Person A rents a share from B for a small fee.
A then sells that stock and buys it back later when the rental agreement runs out. If the price went down in between, A made a profit.

That's how you can bet on falling prices, on a company failing.

It didn't work this time because the hedge fonds got too greedy, signed too many rental agreements and there aren't enough shares to return now.</text>

    <text>Think about it this way.  Person A holds a share.  Person B borrows the share to sell to person C.  Person D borrows the share from person C to sell to person E.

So now you have 2 people short on one share, and you need to unravel that to pay everyone back.  Person B and D both owe a share.  If Person B (or D) can buy a share from Person F, person D (or B) can then buy the freshly repaid share to repay the other person.</text>

    <text>The hedge funds were betting on the stocks going down (e.g. eventual backruptcy of GameStop). They were "short selling" the stocks, which means that they "sold" the stocks at $10 to buy them back at $1, so that they buy low and sell high. 
Thanks to r/wallstreetbets, the stock price is now over $300 so the funds have to buy the stocks back at $300 (buying high ($300), selling low ($10)) which results in huge losses for the hedge funds.

P.S. this is a very simplified explanation and there are a lot of other things at play here (such as market makers having to settle call options)</text>

    <text>One of them buys the stock and returns it to the borrower. The borrower likes the huge price and sells it to another hedge fund who has to return it to another borrower. One stock can be used this way to repay several shorts. The kicker is that the funds are FORCED to return the stock they borrowed so they have to buy it at whatever price it's available at. Your question is basically how can we come up with an extra x% of the stocks than the total there is on the market. But a more interesting point of view is - all these redditors are saying they won't sell no matter what the price is. Basically they are removing the stocks from the trade. So it's not 40% extra or a 140% extra. If everyone holds, it can be 100000's of % more stocks needed to be returned to borrowers than there are around. What happens to the price then? What happens to the short seller? In the extreme thought experiment case what if redditors buy up literally every stock on the market and there isn't one stock around to buy to be able to return to the borrower?</text>

    <text>They weren't. Shorting is like investing in reverse - selling shares now for higher price to buy them later when they're cheap. It can be done by borrowing shares and there are other ways. It's basically betting than the company will fail, as opposed to betting it will success with regular investing.</text>

    <text>Yes they have to be bought eventually to close their positions.

Normally not all of them would close at once, so over time they can all buy the shares they need to close out.  Them having to buy all at once is what causes a short squeeze.  It forces the stock price up rapidly because of all the short positions trying to close at the same time.  Now... when you have a *ton* of people holding the stock and refusing to sell (like the wsb army is) it reduces the supply even more.  Which then makes the short squeeze even more violent.

    <text>WSB was basically a bunch of memes where people would throw away money to try and get big gains.Kinda like a circlejerk sub, but with people actually using money to live it out. Some of the people there are actually smart and do make decent choices. So it's similar to other subs where you only really see extreme positives and extreme negatives. So motivation initially was likely "for the memes". Then it became entirely possible for more people to do it for the crazy memes. And that one dude bought 50 K worth of shares extremely early started getting a shitton of money because of the short, which leads to more people following suit. Now it's basically a "rebel against the rich!" meme and will be that way for the foreseeable future.</text>

    <text>Short selling involves taking a loan.  Loans have collateral.  

Like you can stop paying your mortgage, but they'll come take your house.  In this case, the lender can (probably with many steps involved) seize all the assets of the borrower, sell them, and pocket the money.</text>

Yeah, about that... I read that they expected the share price to go to zero,  bankrupt the company, make the shares a moot point and therefore make *huge* money. 

Or I understand that they may have just expected it to go down and then either ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ OR they’d move shares around a bunch of times to “pay” them back?

Either way, I think what they did is called naked short selling, which is doing shorts without really having money or shares available to pay back what they owe. 

I heard that naked short selling was supposed to have been made illegal back in 2008. But I don’t know if that’s true. Though if it was, enforcement is apparently lacking?</text>

    <text>You would not be a successful short seller if you told me you were going to drive down the price of oranges while trying to rent them from me! 

I might consider if you've done it in the past, but maybe I hope that after you drive down the price, orange prices will rebound. After all, I got the rent, and I still own the oranges.</text>

    <text>There is no speculation. Robinhood is in the pocket of the institutional investors (hedge funds). It's public knowledge.  


Since Robinhood doesn't charge fees on trading, they make their profit by selling the trading data of users on their platform to hedge funds. Financially, they care more about the hedge funds than the retail investors because the hedge funds are the ones paying them.</text>

    <text>Borrowed from another /u credit due but dont remember who:

* GameStop is a mall retailer
* General trend is they go under (like Sears)
* People by default pigeonhole them with Sears and sentiment drops
* Covid hits and company suffers
* Wall Street vultures want to kill it off and start shorting it
* Stock at $4 and they continue with no regard to actual value... Let alone bankrupting a firm that employs 50.000
* Some people (Michael Burry) start running thr actual numbers and see there is some value, they start investing (mid 2019)
* Few regular joes notice the same thing and find out shorts will continue to fuck with stock and push it down no matter how it is performing. They short it 139%... Sold more shares than there are.
* For shorts to cover, they need to buy back the shares. They pay interest on the shares they bought to immediately sell short. If they start buying back the price goes up.
* people start buying stock and not letting it be shorted, it drives price a bit up. Hedge funds shorting the company are losing money if they cover so they double down trying to bring the price lower. Mainstream media is giving huge publicity to GME
* people continue to buy and hold... Hedge losing money so they start selling options at a crazy premium thinking they will shake us off and collect, after stock dives due to their manipulation (Monday was a great example)
* other funds on wall street smell blood and want in. Short hedge funds caught themselves in their own trap. First the gamma squeez then the short squeez (margin call)
* they lose 3bn so they get bailed out by their rich friends as not to get margin called.
* until here they could have saved themselves if they flipped-
* they return the next day and try to repeat. - instead, it backfires and stock keeps shooting up. They are on their knees at market close, about to get margin called ($175 per share)
* Elon tweets afterhours and it punches up the stock even higher by other wallstreet funds (like BlackRoc)/($220) probably about to wipe that fund and finish some careers.
* WSB doesn't have the purchasing power to do this. We simply made it public and piggybackef off of something bound to happen like a sunrise coming from the east.

&amp;#x200B;

Now brokers like RobinHood - feeling pressure from the big banks and stopped people from buying more shares, which means the market is rigged,  BUT they are receiving a huge backlash form the public,  which they deserve, and I hope they and other brokers who only pretend to cater to the masses when in reality are in bed with the banks are collateral damage to this war on the hedge funds.</text>

    <text>&gt; who ends up profiting from creating this hype to buy Gamestop shares?

People who sell their shares for more than they bought them for.

&gt; Not the person who buys today at a ridiculously inflated price. This seems a lot like bitcoin -overhyped crowd-sourcing of investors, many of whom lose out by joining the rollercoaster at the wrong time. 

Right, nobody knows the future.  When gamestop was $40 a share, it looked way overpriced.  But a week later, man, you wish you had bought some, eh?  Or better yet, some cheap call options for absurd prices.  

&gt; It seems like there is a crew of cynical profiteers who're not really that different from the hedge fund guys

Everybody wants that money.

&gt; somebody is going to lose their shirt when this show is over.

Correct!  They're betting it's the short sellers that are going to lose their shirt, and they will be able to sell it at astronomical prices to those short sellers.  They're basing this on how heavily shorted GME is -- That's untapped demand for the stock to cover those short positions, but if the price goes high enough, it becomes real demand as they're FORCED to cover their short positions.  

I don't know the future -- I'm just watching the show.  It's guaranteed that some people will hold too long, and ride the roller coaster all the way down.  And some other people will correctly predict the top, short the shit out of it, and make money all the way down.</text>

    <text>1. For investors like us shares are almost always traded between investors. So if I want to buy a share of gamestop I need to find someone else to sell me a share. That's what brokers are for, they facilitate those trades by keeping a large inventory themselves to buy and sell with as well as setting up trades between othe parities as an agent. 

2. Yes. Theres a lot of ideas here but I like to look at it like this: NOK is $5 a share. I think people's excitement will create demand which raises the price. I think the excitement comes from hype. I also think they're well positioned to benefit from 5g business in the US and China so I think they should be worth more than $5. So I'll buy them at 5 in the hope of them going to 10.</text>

    <text>There are lots of websites and apps you can use. E-Trade, Charles Schwab, think of a financial type name and you can probably open an account and trade with them. If you already have a 401k you can probably use your already existing account through the site holding that. Some banks let you buy mutual funds and ETFs, as well, not sure if any let you buy regular single stocks. 

If it's a new account, it'll take a little time. You have to transfer or wire money into the account before you can buy anything. That can take a couple of days.

If you've never done this before, look up the rules about capital gains taxes so they don't take you by surprise. If you make any actual money they'll send you a 1099 at the end of the year and you'll need to claim it on your taxes.</text>

    <text>The way I've had shorting explained is that someone (a hedge fund) borrows stocks, sells them, and buys then back later when they need to return them. My question is: how does this borrowing work, and why is there financial incentive for somebody to lend their stocks like this? Perhaps phrased another way, where do hedge funds get access to the stocks they short sell?</text>

    <text>They already did.  The CEO claimed on Chris Cuomo's show tonight that they had to follow strict regulations as all brokerage firms must do and that what they did is not unusual.  I know I'm not explaining in detail his answers because I did not understand it but one thing is perfectly clear.  Cuomo pressured him and emphatically asked him if they were pressured by Citadel and he said absolutely not.  However, if it is found they were and subsequently bowed to that pressure, that will become the biggest financial story in the history of the market.  Billions in class action suits would be at stake as would most certainly prison for those who took part. After 2009, nobody's in the mood to slap wrists anymore.</text>

    <text>yes, retards (self-admitted) on r/wallstreetbets bought stocks to drive the price of gamestock (the important stock) up because it has been undervalued on purpose by big companies. these companies were betting veryyyy heavily that gamestop would fail, and they were right because they made it happen by manipulating the market. however, the big companies bet against gamestop in a way that they have infinite lost potential, which means the higher the stock rises, the more theyll have to pay eventually, which in of itself will raise the price higher again. this is called a short squeeze. one redditor saw this was going to happen in 2019, he invested 50k, then took a 700k profit and reinvested that a couple months later, and is now up ~30 million USD (he was at 50 million yesterday but the price dropped today because a couple trading platforms broke federal law trying to help the companies that are losing money (which is unbelievable that they did it so blatantly and has caused a wave of outrage). however, if you invested at literally any stage between 14th and 28th of January and held for a day you would have made a nice sum of profit. if you google GME stock and select the 1 week history, you can see the super sharp increase. this happened because everybody on that sub realised what could happen at around the same time</text>

    <text>People didn't buy from Robinhood, Robinhood is just a broker. They still hold their shares. 

We don't know. There's a LOT of misinformation being thrown around, but it doesn't look like enough shares moved around to get Melvin out of the woods. 

Right now, the fatcats are doing whatever they can to force the price back down so they don't get royally fucked. Maybe their efforts work and the squeeze is survivable, in which case anyone at WSB who bought at the height of the rollercoaster loses big. Maybe they didn't get out, and a short squeeze the likes of which has never been seen hits, and GME absolutely rockets to Pluto...for a few days until Melvin either covers their shares or goes bankrupt, the shorts disappear, and the price stabilizes to something above what it used to be but well below the peak. Then WSB is 50/50 losses and gains, depending on whether you bought in early enough or at the right dip. 

The retards will diamond hand all the way to a likely loss, the smart ones will hold out for a while and sell during a ridiculous peak and make some pretty great cash. But that's the difficult part of gambling, figuring out when to hold and when to fold.</text>

Also, what is to stop hedge funds from simply... waiting it out until the hype dies out and for the stock to (I would assume) lower in value from decreased trading?  Who's asking them to return their shares for their possible $billions in losses?  If WSB folk just hold out, why can't hedge funds hold out in returning their borrowed shares?

    <text>There are 100 cows.
A hedge-fund believes that the milk consumption will go to zero, so they borrow the 100 cows for one month and sell them for $1 each.

Then they borrow them again, and sell them once more for 90c. Certain that they will worth $0 at the end of the month

A Redditor notices this. She knows that in a month's time, the hedge-fund will have to buy 200 cows, and there are only 100 available.

Her plan is simple. Buy all 100 cows, and at the end of the month, when the hedge fund will have to buy the cows back(twice), she will be able to dictate the price.

Hedge-fund cries foul. Doesn't like being beaten in its own game.

Milk consumption doesn't even matter.</text>

    <text>It originated from WallStreetBets. Imagine if 4chan had money, but without all the weird shit and thats basically WSB.

So, what happened. A big hedge fund named Melvin Capital short sold Gamestop - mostly because its a brick and morter shop and those have been suffering a lot during the pandemic. A "short sell" is basically like borrowing something and promising to pay back later. For instance, I have an apple and you want to "short sell" that apple.i give you that apple with the expectation that you give me it back tomorrow. You then sell that apple for $1. You then hope that tomorrow apples are selling for less than a dollar.

Thats essentially what Melvin Capital did. But they got greedy. They ignored all of the Greeks (financial term for complicated financial mathematical formulas) and went in hard. So hard that they didn't have the money to pay for it. So they borrowed. "Tommorow" in this allegory is the end of this month. WSB saw this. So they started buying apples because they knew tomorrow was coming and the play didn't make sense. As they started buying, the price went up. Now apples are more than $1. And Melvin HAS to pay back the apples, no matter the cost.

I believe Melvin bought out of their position, but it cost something like 2.6b.

The important takeaway is that Melvin was trying to force a position - by short selling that much, they wanted the price to go down. The general public thought that was a stupid move and hedged against them. Now there are cries of market manipulation etc and - personally, as a finance dude - I think its fucking hilarious that some wannabe wolf of wallstreet lost their ass due to the general public disagreeing with them.</text>

    <text>The float is just a measure of regular trade volume, not actual shares outstanding, so it is a common misconception to think that more people are short the company than long.</text>

    <text>How reddit (since most sources point out here) have managed to pump up the price of stocks to over 1000% over last 2 weeks? Was is completely artificial value based only on demand? When I looked up GameStop it looked like it's in a huge decline in value in past years.</text>

    <text>That is literally the worst that could happen. You will spend $1000 on something that is ultimately worthless and you won't be able to get your money back.

    <text>Just because they aren't paying dividends *now* doesn't mean they won't *later*. The hope is that your patience will pay off and the return will be great enough to justify waiting. Not receiving dividends also often means that the company is reinvesting that money instead of paying it out, which helps grow the company. Not getting $2 worth of dividends today would be worth it if that $2 helps buy, say, a new factory machine that increases productivity so that tomorrow the dividend is $5.</text>

    <text>Glad to be receiving feedback like this. I’m new in this field too and just threw my understanding out there. But why risk so much money, then get in bed with people that have the ability to manipulate the market just because you lost money? Why short over 100% of the stock if you aren’t willing to take this risk? And side note: how the hell do you short over 100% of a stock? What does that mean?</text>

    <text>150% of float means 150% of the shares that are available for trading. That is different from the *total* number.

If there are 100 million shares outstanding (i.e. in existence) and 40 million are shorted, then 40% of all shares are shorted. But if there are only 20 million available to trade then you have a short of 200% float.

As for what "available" means, generally it means stock owned by the public that is available to trade. The stock that the *company* owns doesn't count, since it's not available to the public to trade. Same goes for employees who get stock. They are given RSUs (restricted stock units) which also cannot be freely traded except outside of blackout days, which amount to 1-2 weeks every quarter if memory serves. Point is they're not available to freely trade whenever.</text>

    <text>I was watching the gme shit go down today and saw something's I was hoping someone could break down for me.

This afternoon's low point was like $193, right? Right as market closed it fucking dropped according to ameritrade from $300-something down to $193 again. That just a ui blip or is that how stocks work?

Also, that dip in the afternoon looked wierd. Like, it [plateaued at $193](https://postimg.cc/Cztp5Xyy) and wouldn't fall anymore? What was happening there?

    <text>I'm literally just learning about this stuff but from what I understand, some shares were shorted more than once, so they would have to buy them back more than once to give to the different people they loaned them from. So really, if there are X shares on the market, they would have to but 1.5 times X shares, if that makes sense.</text>

    <text>It originated from wallstreetbets.
So the idea is that large funds have short the gamestop Stock. They have shorted it with 140% meaning 140% of the available Stock. 
Shorting works like this: lets say the Stock is 10$, u borrow one Stock and sell it immidiatly for 10$. U dont Owe 10$ but 1 Stock. Lets say the Price then falls to 8$, u now buy the Stock back and return the owed Stock. U Keep the 10$ but only pay 8$ to return the Stock, leaving u with 2$ profit. 

What is happening with gamestop is that reddit has seen the Big short on gamestop, and devided to buy, this makes the Price rise. Now the funds are in knee deep shit, they have to return the borrowed stocks, but now the Price is Way higher. This only works because alot of small investors keep buying and keeps not Selling.

When the funds eventually buy back the Stock for a higher Price, the Price Will go even higher, this is what is making us money right now</text>

    <text>No no, split share is when you own a potion of a stock, i can buy 100 dollars of amazon stock and i am a legal owner of 0.04 amazon stock, dilution is when a company makes more shares and sells it to the public, very different. Number of shares go up. When buying split shares, number of shares dont change</text>

    <text>As we know, the rich will always keep getting richer.  And, they will always need somewhere to park their cash.  Other than the stock market, where else would they put it?

Assuming there's no good answer to the above, wouldn't the overall stock market, over time, always go up? Meaning, even with record highs, it's still the best place to park your money, long term?

Sure, during downturns, a large number of people may pull money out, and put it in.. what.. bonds?  But where else do you get the returns of stocks?  Wouldn't they all eventually come back to stocks, for those sweet gains?

Sorry if this is an ignorant question.</text>

    <text>So if a stock had no volume, the first buy on the stock would have a giant impact on it’s market value. Each time you buy a stock, you very slightly impact the volume of the stock, changing the price of it ever so slightly. GME deflated radically today, but there was no volume behind it, meaning that it wasn’t deflating because of people selling, but rather something more tedious and sinister; market manipulation.</text>

    <text>Yes. What often occurs is the broker enforces a "margin call", requiring the hedge fund to either put up more capital to leverage the loss or to simply repurchase the stock to settle with the original lender. They immediately lose profit, but they can recover identically as any market actor is doing now to make profits: take out another short position at the new price, engage in an options contract, etc.</text>

    <text>Some hedge fund managers are assholes.  Others are not.  But the ones that are REALLY suck.

Hedge fund managers, in theory, compete in the free market.  They take on exorbitant amounts of risk on behalf of their clients.  They actively influence the markets everyday -- they come up with an investment thesis, share it with their friends (other major investors), and spread their ideas widely in the market or on TV to build momentum for their trade (sound familiar?).  None of this would be bad if everyone was playing by the same set of rules.

But in many ways, we aren't playing by the same set of rules.  Members of r/wallstreetbets identified a great trade in GameStop, a company that was legitimately undervalued but also had extraordinary characteristics that gave it the incredibly upside of a short squeeze.  So retail traders, like any other class of investors, began to take advantage of this.  And the people that stood to lose?  Hedge fund managers on the other side that were overextended and exposed themselves to too much risk.  This would all be well and good if the hedge fund guys ate their losses.  Those are the stakes in a free market and when you have leverage, you exploit it.

But what we are seeing is extraordinary, blatant market manipulation to try and screw retail investors to avoid their losses.  Misinformation and lies (FUD) on national TV (this could be illegal).  Restriction of buying on exchanges with coordinated short attacks to drive down the price (definitely illegal).  Fund managers are going on CNBC claiming that a bunch of idiots of Reddit are "targeting rich people."  They can't comprehend that a bunch of normal investors outfoxed them.  These are the same fucks that caused the subprime mortgage crisis.

TLDR:  It's a combination of market manipulation, public lies, and complete entitlement.</text>

    <text>Think of it a different way. A stock is worth $100 today and I tell you I'll sell it to you for $99 in a week. You think it will be worth $100 or more so it's a deal. My hope is in a week it will actually be worth $50. A week goes by and its value drops to $50 so time for the sale. I go buy the stock at $50 so I can sell it to you and you have to pay me $100 because that was our deal.

Actual shorting has more complicated mechanics, but this is basically how it works. There are a lot of other ways to "play" in the market outside of buying and selling stock. Derivatives (think of that as making a bet on a stock going up without actually owning it) options, etc.

Understanding why shorting is problematic though is way more complicated.</text>

    <text>Because they have money pooled from big clients, money that goes to Billions. Hedge fund managers have a lot of power in their hands as a lot of money can move a little of market. And a little of market movement makes a lot of money from a lot of money.

The hate is because they move the stock on their will. And often, if they want a stock to fall, they spit out negative stories about it. Give low targets, predict that the stock will fall by $50 and when small investors like us read that and take out our money for a small profit or often loss, they bet for the stock to fall (that they caused) and make a lot of money again.

And they also do it in reverse. They see a small stock, give unrealistic or very very heightened stock price targets. They buy those stocks and we buy because price goes up, so we think that big players know more than us obviously. Then once they have the price up sufficiently, they remove their hands and people who bought at near the peak get fucked royally.</text>

    <text>Just look at the popular boomer stocks. Investing is an exercise in controlling your emotions. Be willing to ensure some loss while in search of greater gains. Don't get into a cycle of buying during a rally, seeing the price drop, panicking, selling, then seeing the price rise again, and then buying higher than you sold. I've been there.

    <text>From what I understand, they don’t buy the stock. They “bet” the stock is going to short, and if it does they make money. I believe it’s pretty much the opposite of investing. You invest hoping the stock will go up, but these hedge funds bet hoping the stock will short.</text>

    <text>"buy the dip" just means buy when it's low. Hold means don't sell. The stock has been wildly erratic today, and they're trying to get more people to buy each time it dips and to hold and not sell so that it won't sink further. Some people doing this are people who got in very early and are just trying to maximize their profits. Others are not very smart people who bought when the stock was already going for hundreds and now desperately need it to stay valuable or they lose their shirts.</text>

    <text>So I will explain this from the perspective of GME only and I would certainly not follow this advice all the time.

Buy the dip = buy more shares when the share price falls by a fair amount. Keep in mind that we insignificant peasants at our computers holding 3 shares lack the financial power to make share prices shift drastically. Steep declines happen when a very large volume of shares exchanges hands very quickly. 

If you look at GME over the recent past, there have been several large dips and each time the price eventually comes back up later in the day. The GME Collective has become normalized to it and so when it happens, the hive mind chalks it up to hedge funds playing games to manipulate the stock price down so we unsophisticated morons panic and sell. 

So how to counter? Hold + buy the dip (seller of the dip being large funds). If the funds' games don't work (i.e. cause panic selling), the collective becomes stronger.</text>

    <text>I think you’re correct in assuming that advising the masses to “buy the dip” and “hold” is paradoxical. The key information here is that individual retail traders aren’t bound to act uniformly so if some people start selling for whatever reason then the rest of the people will buy the dip and continue to hold. The “hold” advice on a larger picture can be thought of as that it’s still fucking over Wall Street if an individual investor caves to the pressure and other individuals swoop in to buy before the fat cats then those shares can still be held. Then it will be held by another more persistent retail investor which was effectively what was was happening before. I.e as long as the people keep picking up the slack then Wall Street can’t escape their shorting positions. 

It’s like advising an army to MAN THE FRONT WALL to prevent attack but also if your neighbouring guard bails and the side gate starts to crack then REPAIR THE WALL and then KEEP MANNING THE FRONT WALL.

As for your second point that the holders will sell  at some point. The masses have figured out that they can push that point to be much further away than the Wall Street funds can afford. Theoretically there is potential for infinite losses in shorting a stock because a stock could potentially keep increasing in price until its worth an infinite amount of money. And when your shorting position comes to the end of its term and it’s time to pay back that stock you borrowed then you’re obligated to buy a stock worth an infinite amount of dollars. Yikes!

Where will the price be after the colliding of these two ideas comes to an end is anybody’s guess.</text>

    <text>When you sell a stock, you are selling it to another investor. That could be a person. It could be a large financial group. 

Today, most of the buying and selling are done with computer programs, where "I am looking to buy X amount of Y stock" gets matched with "I am looking to sell X amount of Y stock."    


If you sell all your stock, rather than trade it, you get to keep the money that you got from it. Like, if you needed money to get a new car, you could sell all your shares in ExampleCo, and take the money people paid you for those shares to help pay for that new car.</text>

    <text>(Copy paste from my previous answer somewhere else as to why people are mad at Robinhood): Citadel pays Robinhood a lot of money for market orders to go through them cause they want to know how millennials invest (RH has a super young user base). Citadel also took a large short position in GME and were presumably losing billions. Citadel (and supposedly the White House (allegedly, ok) and some other important people) have been scared shitless so they pressured RH and other brokerages like Webull and TD Ameritrade to stop the purchases of stocks like GME that were losing them billions as well as doubling (tripling? Quadrupling? Idk lol) down on their shorts right before stopping retail traders access to the markets ([source 1](https://twitter.com/justinkan/status/1354853920762253315?s=21), [source 2](https://twitter.com/traesop/status/1354856069961539589?s=21)). People are up in arms over this on Twitter, and has even united AOC, Ted Cruz, and Donald Trump Jr (lol) [(source)](https://twitter.com/tedcruz/status/1354833603943931905?s=21) on this issue of the idea of a “free and fair” market being a thinly veiled lie as soon as the big boys start losing. RH is now supposedly also [automatically selling users shares without their permission](https://twitter.com/primordial_oops/status/1354865278111404036?s=21) in order to “minimize risk” but everyone knows that they’re full of shit. When you go to the stock you get a message saying you can only sell, not buy, meaning the average retail investor can’t average down or help push the price back up and are at the mercy of the hedge funds who are doing everything in their power to push the price down including (illegal but will never be punished for) naked short selling. Considering over half of RH users own GME you can see why this would be a big deal. Me personally I got fucked over by them doing the same thing with BB (BlackBerry) but a lot of what is happening is you’re seeing RH act in order to save themselves, which completely goes against what they previously [said](https://twitter.com/robinhoodapp/status/712708069369782272?s=21). Long story short, the markets are and always have been all about market makers and the biggest hedge funds while retail investors continue to get fucked over, it’s just now there’s worldwide attention to it.</text>

    <text>I know what you’re saying and I agree. $1M isn’t alot in the long run.

But just realize though that for some Americans, $20 is alot of money.  I’ve seen it with my own eyes.  The $1M isn’t a lot if you are lucky enough to have had a life long career that pays well enough to save. Some folks will never have that opportunity. 

Also, and key:  you don’t put all your money into a hedge fund. You diversify just like the rest of us. Now, I’m not a wealth manager at all. Just a peon who googled hedge fund investing once myself. 

The key is though: you have that much dough to diversify. That’s a whole nother word past your average middle class American’s life savings.</text>

    <text> “buy the dip” just means if you see the price dip buy more of the stock. What they want to avoid is the price dipping and everybody thinking that it’s reached its peak and then sell, which would drive the price down to the ground.

At some point it’ll end a bunch of people who have invested money into it after this initially happened will lose a lot of money.</text>

    <text>Basically it’s like gambling. You buy a stock for cheep and you can sell it for more if the price rises. The more people the “rare” the stock is cause there’s less in circulation. You can do option trading which is based on contracts that you pick and this is called puts and calls. Instead of buying shares you buy a contract and depending on the type (whether is put or call), you hope the stock price goes up and down. Hedge Funds shorted or (bought puts) on GameStop, they bought so much in fact that there wasn’t even enough shares in circulation. People noticed this and realized if they drove up the price the hedge funds would loss a lot of money because there betting the stock would go down. Now with contracts there legally obligated to “buy back” what they promised. (They borrowed shares they didn’t have and now they have to pay them back). Unfortunately they borrowed more then was actually in circulation so now they owe a ridiculous amount of shares. Once they pay everyone back they’ll be bankrupt and we’ll have all there tendies(money).</text>

    <text>Can anyone explain exactly what is supposed to happen when the short options expire.

My very very basic understanding is they bought short options which is a commitment to buy stock by certain date after borrowing it immediately then they sell it on hoping to buy it at a lower price and they lose out big if the price goes up instead.

So a bunch of people bought and the price went up and the options are due to expire today causing them to have to buy at current pricing. 

Two major issues come up here, what happens if a hedge fund simply declares bankruptcy and can't cover it, is there some kind of insurance/cover somewhere that decided hey this bet is safe and if it fails we cover it?

More than that, if people just choose not to sell then what happens then? At this point also what happens if people don't sell today, do the options not expire then the stock crashes because it's not good, why are people saying to hold. Isn't the only reason it's high because of the options that expire, or is this because only some of the options expire today.

Is it more a case of the hedge funds involved can easily cover it but they don't have the cash meaning to cover the buys they have to sell a shitload of other stock to be able to cover it. It's just, if people aren't selling then how do the hedge fund buy the stock at higher prices?</text>

    <text>For a bit of backstory first on what short-selling is to help you understand.

We all know the stock market is "buy low, sell high". Well there short-selling is where it is the reverse. You borrow someone else's share, lets say it's worth £10, you now owe them 1 share in that company. You sell it and gain £10, but you still owe the guy that share. So you wait for it to go down to say £5 and buy it back. You give the share back to the original owner and pocket the £5 profit.

It's a highly risky form of investment because usually you only lose what you put in, but in short-selling, if the value goes up there is no limit to how much you can lose. Additionally, and this part is important for later, if the value of that share say goes up to £100, well the original owner is going to want that share back now, so he'll call in your debt. Meaning that against your best wishes you will be forced to buy it back, taking the £90 loss and driving up the price of the share further.

What happened with Gamestop is that it is speculated that it is the most shorted stock on the market, estimates are 30%+ of all Gamestop shares are shorted by people expecting them to go down. So a bunch of redditors bought the stock to increase the value of the stock, meaning all those Wall Street people that bet on them losing are as it stands making a loss. Because the stock is so high it has caused the original owners of the stock to call in their debts, meaning Wall Street are being forced to buy back all the shares they borrowed, meaning the price goes up *even further*. It's a crash, except in the opposite direction, instead of a mass selling decreasing value, it is mass buying to increase the value.

Remember how I said it's risky because there is no limit to how much you can lose. Well the Wall Street guys probably borrowed the stock at $4 per share. Wall Street do not mess around, they likely buy hundreds of thousands of shares at once. Lets imagine we are being generous and say they only bought 50,000. That's $200,000. At the end of yesterday the value was at $250 per share. That's a value of $12.5mil, meaning a loss of $12.3mil.

Currently, Wall Street are estimated to be in debt of around $70 billion. A huge chunk of that money is being taken by Redditors who bought the stock low and created an inverse crash which they are profiting from. What is interesting is that many Redditors and now many other people are jumping in and buying and purposefully never selling to keep the value high for as long as possible, it stopped being about making a profit and is more about bleeding Wall Street dry, even if some people make a loss. Because what is $300 to one person, when you can make Wall Street bleed for billions is how a lot of people are seeing it.

The fallout of this is that the apps that the ordinary Joe uses to buy shares is restricting new purchases of the stocks that are inverted crashing. Many people are annoyed at this because it is manipulation of the market which is illegal and that this was never a problem when the rich play the game, but as soon as the ordinary man play the game it's suddenly "illegal" or "against policy". It's gone from a bit of a meme, to perhaps quickly turning in a class war for the blatant difference in how the wealthy and the poor are treated in a supposed free market.</text>

    <text>Yes, it's exactly like renting a car. You sign a contract, pay a price for the duration of the rental, return the car before the agreed upon date.  
Except here you can return another, identical car. So if you think that for some reason, this specific brand/model of car is going to lose value, you could sell it at the beginning of the rental period full price, and buy the same one for cheaper when you think its value is at its lowest, then return it to the rental office. You pocket the difference, which of course should be significantly higher than the price of the rental.  

The problem here is that the car is now worth 20 times what it was when you sold it. And you can't find a car in the first place because no one wants to sell theirs. And your rental period is coming to an end, but you have to find one at any cost. And that search for a car at any cost, very ironically, drives its price higher and higher. And you are in a race with other people in the exact same predicament.</text>

    <text>No, minors cannot invest in stocks on their own. Your guardian can set up a [custodial account](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/set-kids-brokerage-account) which they control and you gain ownership of when you turn 18.

Investing in the stock market is done through a brokerage account. Examples of brokerages you may have heard of include Charles Schwab, Fidelity, Vanguard, as well as brokerage apps such as Robinhood, SoFi, and Acorns. But again, you cannot open your own account as a minor.</text>

    <text>Basically, r/wallstreetbets noticed that a user named u/deepfuckingvalue was buying loads of Gamestock stocks last year, and everybody was calling him out for making such a stupid trade. Fast forward to this month when a new investor was announced to be on the board of Gamestock and the price jumps up. This meant that hedge fund managers who believed that GME would just keep dying from the pandemic and the slow decay of physical game sales started to lose a lot of money due to their "shorts" (basically its when a hedge fund can make money if they bet that a company will lose money, rather than grow). All these hedge funds started paying out their stocks for much more than they owned them for, resulting in billions of loss for wall street elites, and further skyrocketing the price of GME and putting that money into redditors on WSB and especially DeepFuckingValue. Now DeepFuckingValue is up $50 million from his original i believe around $50,000 investment and many more redditors are profiting and making hundreds of thousands of dollars. Now wall street hedge funds are getting angry that we are able to do this, yet they've been doing the same thing for years without any punishment. If you've ever watched "The Big Short", this is basically the once in a lifetime story right here on Reddit.</text>

    <text>A key thing to note here is institutions short sold GME stock on leverage, to a point of shorting 140% of GME's shares. How can you short more than 100% of shares? Leverage has something to do with this. What is leverage in this context?</text>

    <text>I think I need actual numbers to help me here. The way I understand it can't be right: A lends a stock worth $100 to B. B sells the stock to C for 60% off (so $40, also why would I do this?). C lends the $40 stock to D who sells it to E for another 60% off ($24). That's 24% of the original stock's worth, not 120%. What am I missing? I appreciate you helping me with this. I haven't grasped it yet though.</text>

    <text>I don't get how if you are buying losing stocks to resell, who's buying them back and why? That's the only part I don't get. In the hope they'll be back up to par? That seems unlikely given the pandemic, sounds like a bad bet.

Edit: In retrospect, I guess there are good betters and bad betters. Like that's the whole point, right? I guess I figured it out?

Some are betting that GME will rebound, some aren't.</text>

    <text>&gt; Can someone explain what happened in general? 

Normal (long) trades are where you buy a stock (part ownership in a company), then sell it at a later date.  If the price of the stock went up in the meantime, congratulations, you made money!  Theoretically if the stock price goes to infinity and you can sell those stocks, then you have infinity dollars.  On the other hand, if the price of the stock went down, you lost money.  If the company went out of business, you lost 100%.  

There is also something called shorting, which is like... taking out a loan, but instead of for money, it's for stocks.  Then you sell those stocks.  Later on, you buy those stocks back and return them to the guy who lent them to you.  In this scenario, you make money if the price of the stock goes *down*.  But the risk/reward here is reversed.  If the company goes out of business, you make 100%, but if the stock price goes towards infinity you can lose infinity dollars.

Okay, so GME is the ticker symbol for Gamestop.  Everybody and their mother is like "brick and mortar video games are fucking dead man, everything is online", so they borrow shares of gamestop and sell them (shorting), waiting for them to go out of business.  Or at least waiting for their stock price to drop further, so they can buy them for less, return the shares to the lender, and pocket the difference.

SOOO much gamestop stock was shorted, more than actually exists to be traded.  

Now the genius retards at /r/wallstreetbets realize that all these institutions shorting gamestop, they'll HAVE to buy those shares back to return to whoever lent it to  them, *no matter what the price is*.  So they collectively buy up every gamestop stock they can, until there's no more left to buy.  And that makes the price go up, from $5 to $10 to $20 to $40 to... over $400.  They want the price to go so high that the folks who lent gamestop shares to the short sellers will demand the borrowers (short sellers) return their stock to them.  

And if the short sellers do this, they'll ALSO be buying up any available gamestop stock, *at any price*.  So the price could skyrocket.  Thousands of dollars per share perhaps.  This could bankrupt multi-billion dollar companies.  

Those multi-billion dollar companies appear to be trying everything, including things that may not be legal, to derail this runaway train before they're wiped out.

Also, these multi-billion dollar companies are criminally stupid for putting themselves in this position.

&gt; A bunch of redditors bought stocks?

Yes

&gt; Why is this special?

Because companies who shorted the stocks they bought are now put in the position of having to buy those stocks back.

&gt; What sub did this originate from? 

/r/wallstreetbets 

&gt; Are the redditors now rich?

Some.  Though gains aren't "real" until one sells, which is why there's all this impetus to hold and drive the price higher -- if people start selling, the price will drop.  

And risk correlates to reward here... People who threw $50,000 at it when it was $5 a share might have their net worth change by millions each day this goes on.  People who bought 2 shares at $120 are only going to be fluctuating by hundreds of dollars (potentially thousands if the price goes way up).</text>

    <text>If a hedge fund has short sold 1000 shares, why can't they just buy one, return it, then buy it back, return it again, and repeat 1000x? 

In the same vein, if two hedge funds have to return 1000 shares tomorrow, why can't one buy 1000 shares, return them, then the other buy those same shares and return them?

If they can do those things, why does it matter that redditors are HODLing lots of shares?</text>

    <text>Sadly for the vast majority of people participating, it will all be lost. It will look like just another daily gamma squeeze with the price dropping, people posting diamond-hands memes, and waiting for the recovery. But this time it won't happen, and it keeps dropping all the way to sub-$4 territory.

I can't predict when that will be, but that's how this scenario sorts out. The key is predicting which squeeze will be the last, but retail investors like you or I really aren't in a position to tell that until it's all over. The game is rigged against us through asymmetrical access to information (assuming you don't happen to have a Bloomberg terminal subscription).

I'm not saying don't invest. You should look at the data and make that call yourself. But you should also not invest anything more than you are truly willing to lose*, and you should have limit orders setup at what you think to be reasonably plausible prices.

* Most people aren't able to make this call either. They say "yes, I'm willing to take some risk" but in their heads they are emotionally attached to the winning outcome and refuse to process the very real chance of that not happening. Imagine taking the amount of money you want to invest and literally setting it on fire. Throw it in a dumpster and set it on fire for the lolz. Are you going to be okay with that? You'd better be able to answer YES to that if you're investing in $GME right now.</text>

I know what happens in my accounts when I buy a put options, but who makes this put option for me to buy in the first place? Is someone making a call option that is equivalent to balance this put and vice versa? Is there a twin to every option that balances it out? If not, can I start creating puts out of thin air?</text>

    <text>Explain something. I've seen some comments that say somehow shares that don't exist are being shorted. So I understand the concept of borrowng someone's share, selling it, and then re-buying it later at a lower price, giving their share back, and keeping the profit. 

How can you borrow a share that doesn't exist, and who are you giving the share back to after the price has dropped?</text>

    <text>You pretty much got it, but I've reworded it a bit to make it clearer. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. So Johnny wants to short AA for $5 (let's say each stock is $1 so he needs to get 5 of 'em). He goes to Molly and asks to borrow 5 stocks from her, she agrees and tells him that he can give it back any time he wants but each day he has to pay a **10 cent fee** every day he waits.
2. Johnny then goes out and sells those 5 stocks to Billy and he makes **+$5** in profit.
3. Now he waits a bit and is hoping to buy the stocks for a lower amount, say each stock for **$0.5** so that he would make a profit of **$2.5** (minus the 10 cent/day fee to Molly)
4. But some motherfudgers on Reddit buy the stock and it is now selling for **$1000** a piece. If he were to buy it he would make a loss of **$4995** (plus the 10cent/day fee to Molly)
5. Johnny is an evil billionaire and has stake in a company called HobinRood and he orders them to stop people from buying the stock and ONLY allow selling. That way the price can dip below $5 and they he can still make profit  

6. And now we wait and see what happens (also, Johnny has said that he already closed his position but he could still be a motherfudging liar so who knows?).</text>

If a bunch of guys look at publicly available information and say "bro these idiots overleveraged their short position lets buy to squeeze them out" is not market manipulation, its simply the market doing market stuff. Trading and publicly discussing how to trade based on information that's publicly avaliable is ABSOLUTELY gucci. 

Its market manipulation tho if you stop people from buying and only allowing to sell, forcing the price down. Lol</text>

    <text>Create a TD Ameritrade account, transfer in some money from your bank account. When that clears, you're able to make trades.

LOTS of stocks have jumped as of late. Everyone is relatively positive right now, with vaccines being distributed. It's not a good time to buy for short term gains. 

Within 6 months to a year from now, you can expect 20%+ returns, since not everything has recovered from the pandemic. This is unusually high - and I do suggest you do it - if you have the extra money to invest.</text>

    <text>I took this from another reddit comment, sorry can't credit it. But it is a pretty clear example to me, and the main thing that sticks out from your example is Johnny would borrow the stock for a fraction of its price, not the full price.

 

You and I are in the trading card bussiness. One day, I think a certain card is about to become less valuable. So, I borrow your copies of the card and pay you a fee for borrowing them, but far cheaper than if I bought them from you. 


So now I have a bunch of borrowed copies of an expensive card that I expect will become worthless. So I sell them to someone else before they become worthless. Now I've got a bunch of money from selling an expensive card, but I owe you your cards back.

So I wait until the value falls. Then I buy the number of cards I owe you, and since I'm buying them when they're much cheaper than when I sold them earlier, I made money.

So, now imagine I sold the cards I borrowed from you, and instead of getting cheaper, they got more expensive. Now I'm going to have to spend more to get your cards back to you.</text>

    <text>I'm not an expert... but when a company goes public, the company then gets 'hopefully' tons of cash from anyone buying shares. Then the company uses that money to expand and make more profit and more profit means more people are interested in the stock and then they buy more and it makes the stock go up in price. E.g airbnb have had to do this recently so they don't go bankrupt, by going public tons of people have given them money in hope for the company to survive and do well in the future. Hope that makes sense</text>

    <text>Pump and dumps are illegal which is what a lot of people think of when they see this short squeeze, the difference however is that a pump and dump involves buying a bunch of one stock, spreading fake information and news to draw in fake hype, and sell once the price climbs. Theres none of that going on here, people simply decided to buy and hold a stock</text>

    <text>I guess the last basic thing to keep track of is risk. Basically everything onwards is common sense, and rich people trying to confuse non-rich people: don’t put your eggs all in oke basket, aka don’t only invest in less than five companies or so, in case you get very unlucky.  If you know a bit of statistics, the more you spread out the investments the likelier it is you don’t get unlucky, it just takes more effort and time to invest.</text>

    <text>If you are a new investor you should not jump into crypto. That's not saying crypto is a bad investment but it's certainly not an "intelligent" one at your stage of experience.

    <text>There are a few main reasons people initially sell portions or all of the company, or put it on the stock market :
1. The owner no longer wants to manage a company, and wants the cash now.
2. The owner wants money to reinvest in their company to grow the price of the stocks they didn’t sell.

The point of the stock market is to make this process easier/more practical, as if someone wants to buy a small portion of a company, they can just buy it, rather then having to negotiate (which is much less economically efficient then having the market decide on it) and being forced to buy much larger portions of the company.

If there were no stock market, companies would be sold much less efficiently and much less often.

Sorry if it was a poor explanation, though I am moderately educated on the subject, I’m far from an expert.</text>

    <text>I'd suggest Coinbase or Binance as exchanges.

Coinbase is bigger (in terms of liquidity), but they have fewer coins available. They're generally trying to bring crypto buying to the masses. So it's more geared towards casual users. They also offer a real exchange-like interface (coinbase pro).

Binance is also a big exchange, but they offer a shitton of different cryptos. If you want to invest in some less mainstream coins, then go to Binance. However, the interface may be a bit overwhelming for newcomers.

depending on which exchange you choose, I'd suggest just looking for some youtube tutorials that explain how to use those interfaces. 

But other than that, your goto sites should be either coinmarketcap.com or coingecko.com

These sites give you an overview of the current state of crypto and which coins are currently trending high. Make sure you always pay attention to a coins market cap - not the price per coin. Bitcoin is currently worth 30k while Ethereum is worth 1k. That doesn't mean that Bitcoin is 30 times more valuable.

Generally, be careful when doing research on this topic. When it comes to money, almost everybody online is going to try to scam you somehow.

Other than that, you can pm me if you have some specific questions</text>

    <text>Safer funding. Let's say you've got an opportunity to earn 5 billion dollars, but you need to spend 2 billion dollars upfront. You only have 1 billion dollars. You sell "shares" worth 1 billion to raise the money. And when the 5 billion profit comes, you'll split it 50/50 for 2.5 billion each, since you &amp; the other "shareholder" contributed 1 billion each.

You could go to a bank and get a 1 billion loan. There's a problem with that. If the project fails, you lose your initial 1 billion and you owe the bank another 1 billion on top of that. But if it succeeds, you've earned 4 billion (after paying back the 1 billion bank loan). So, it's a high risk high reward game. Some guys like it that way. Companies who prefer lower risk for lower rewards go for selling shares.</text>

    <text>You sell shares to raise money, e.g. if you want to expand, work on a new project or just keep things going.  

'Unlisted companies' i.e. companies who do not put their shares up for sale on the stock market can also sell shares privately, to small numbers of shareholders they already know (e.g. their own management). Putting it up on a stock market gives the company access to lots of investors putting money in the company.

Edit: where the company has already taken out existing loans, these loans may have a 'negative pledge' clause i.e. the company promises not to borrow any more (/above a certain sum). so shares are a good alternative</text>

    <text>Just buy a share of gamestop (if you can get it for $200) and hold it forever.  Keep it as a souvenir of the moment, it's historic.  

I bought GME a ways back but I'm definitely at least keeping one share forever just for fun.  It may even pay dividends so you'll get some of that money back eventually.

You can always sell it once it spikes, but if you want to make the hedge fund shorts hurt, just keep the stock.</text>

    <text>When you open an broker account you are given a choice, will you just buy shares with cash or do you want to use margin as well. Margin allows you to borrow additional money on your cash to invest. 

When you chose Margin you get a bunch of legal agreements to accept. Among them is one that authorizes the broker to lend shares you hold on Margin to short sellers. 

Additionally some brokers allow you to opt in or out of lending shares you own. You get no $ from this, but it helps to ensure liquid mkts. 

So when you go into WSBs you will see people suggesting you opt out on your cash account and to buy with cash, rather then margin. The intent is to dry up the shares to borrow. 

Once the shares dry up the short sellers are going to get a call from their broker telling them they need to locate more shares to borrow. The short sellers in turn will call every broker in the industry to locate more shares to borrow. Because if they can’t, they will have to buy back at whatever price the stock is trading at.</text>

    <text>When the price goes down, it’s even cheaper (duh), but it’s also a good time time to jump in because the stock is going to go up (if you hold).

Melvin Capital shorted GameStop to the tune of about 150% of all the available stock, and those shorts are coming due in the next few days.

If everyone holds (ie doesn’t sell their stocks) then the price goes up because there is literally an infinite demand (because the hedge fund shorted more stocks than were actually on the market).

It’s a classic prisoner dilemma, but with millions of small investors basically. Millionaires will be made in the next week or two barring trading platforms and stock exchanges from stepping in and stopping the little guy from making a buck</text>

    <text>They borrow the stocks from their brokers. The broker is basically someone who goes out does all the selling and buying for you. If I say "I want to buy 1000 shares of this company for this much $$", the broker is the one actually going out and buying those shares from people to sell to you at the same price. Everything is paid to the broker.

An important note is that hedge fund brokers are different from the brokers us peasants have access to. They have *prime* brokers.</text>

    <text>They borrow shares from their broker and instantly sells them, then promises to buy them back. They get a date and after that date there will be big fees for not buying it back, and those grow each day so you have a big incentive to not go over that date.

Now what they hope is that the stock becomes cheaper so they can buy it back for cheaper to sell and earn a profit over the initial sale from when they borrowed them.

This has become their big problem because the stock has risen so much in value that it's insanely expensive for them to buy it back.

To kind of put it into perspective, when you normally buy a share and own it (called a long position), you can at worst lose your money and that's that. If you invest $1.000 you can at worst lose those $1.000, but in theory those $1.000 can become worth an infinitely high amount, potentially double your money many times over. Your $1.000 can, if lucky, for example end up being worth $20.000. When shorting, you can at max earn back twice your investment and that is when the company goes bankrupt. If you short $1.000 worth of stock, you can at the most double your money to $2.000, again, that is when the stock decreases in value. If unlucky though, the stock can rise 10x as an example, and now you need to buy back the stock which will cost you $20.000.

This is the case with $GME, they shorted the stock for a few dollars each and now it's worth hundreds and can potentially go into the thousands. They'll go bankrupt from their own stupid choices. Also, with $GME specifically what they've done is illegal since it's a [naked short](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nakedshorting.asp), you can search on Google for an explanation of that or click the link, it's a bit technical.</text>

    <text>You buy the dip because you're maximizing profits, assuming the stock is going to rise high above what it is currently at. You keep buying and holding because the hedge funds are legally required to buy your stock (because they bought shorts). Right now, hedge funds are trying backhanded illegal tactics to drive the price down, and cut their losses. Eventually, they will be forced to buy in order to close out. Once they do that, all the holders will start selling. Until then, holding is what is keeping the price alive</text>

    <text>Let's say there are 10 stocks and hedge fund managers shorted at 1$ (they borrowed 10$) now when the short expires they buy back at the current price. So yesterday GME peaked at 460$ that would be 4600 owed for a 10$ borrow or a loss of 4590$ in that example. Now scale those numbers so the loss is gunna be 10-15 billion</text>

    <text>Bus left the station weeks ago when GME started rising at crazy rates.

At this point it is a question of whether to hop on the bus at one of the bus stops along the route. The issue is that you don't know the destination of the bus.

You could hop on 10 stops before the destination (and make a bunch of money as it continues to rise until the destination) or you could end up hopping on only to realize it has already reached it's destination and is returning home (you lose a lot of money as it continues to decrease in value until it gets home).</text>

He held his position despite no support until eventually other began to take a similar position. 99.999% of people that do that will fail. There’s no fail safe get rich quick. If you’re here asking where to go, you’re going to lose money. No one is going to give you the secret sauce. They’re going to give you the stock that they benefit if you buy.</text>

    <text>Borrowing money. Say you invest 100k, pay half upfront, and borrow the other half.

If the value goes up to 125k, you still owe 50k which you borrowed. But now you have 75k in equity.

Doing the math for this transaction (125-100)/50 = 50%

Say you paid all up front (125-100)/100 =25%

If the trade goes against you, let's say the value drops to 75k (75-100)/50 = -50% You still owe the 50k, but now you only have 25k in equity. 

If you paid up front (75-100)/100 = -25%

So you can seriously magnify your risk /return profile. 

This example assumes no interest. In reality, the money borrowed will accrue interest on a daily basis.


There are requirements set forth by the federal reserve which determine how much you need up front and what the minimum equity % is if the trade moves against you.</text>

I pay you $50 and pocket the other $50 as profit. The hedge funds are doing this in the billions .This is my VERY basic idea of it.

    <text>Like borrowing an egg from your neighbor. You don’t pay for it (except interest) to borrow it but since the lender wants protection from you not being able to return it they demand that you keep enough money to get the stock back which is troublesome now when the amount of money needed exploded. The company has no part in this, they are the hen that layer the egg. The lenders are institutions and my broker even let’s you lend out your stock for shorting so I guess also some private investors. The company can issue more stock, but that would lower the value of the rest and come at the expense of everyone owning the stock which is who the company care about, for the purpose of saving greedy shorter that they don’t care about.</text>

    <text>Buy the dip means to just buy at the lowest price you can get it at(since the price will eventually be jacked up due to the nature of the event)as for who is supplying these shares, could be people that lost their nerve or cashed out, or even non-retail traders that had some shares. With the manipulation that's happening right now the dips are mostly caused by the hedge funds trading between each other at lower prices to make it seem like the price is crashing but the reality is that retail traders have been locked out and they're just using scare tactics

As for what the endgame is....well whenever people think they've extracted enough value, the price will stop shooting up and people will start undercutting each other for the lowest price to get out of the position.

Edit - something important to note is that the hedges actually shorted more stock then actually is available, as in, they can't actually fill all the buy orders with the number of stocks possible, so someone is going to get stuck with an unfillable order</text>

    <text>Not an expert, but the way I understand it it's a gamble. If I lend you my stocks it means that I'll sell them to you and then buy them back. If the price goes up, I'm fucked, if the prices go down, you're fucked.

  
As for your last question "why doesn't the company just make more stocks ?", it's because the value of stocks is determined by supply and demand. The more available stocks there are, the cheaper a stock is. So if you own stocks in a company and that company just "makes" more stocks, your stocks will lose value and you will therefore lose money, which will discourage people from investing in your company.

Again, not an expert, but when a company needs money, they make bonds. Which is basically asking for a loan from people and promising to pay them back in interest after they use that money to make a profit.</text>

    <text>the time to get rich quick has come and gone. Now its basically a game of chicken between WSB holders, themselves and hedge funds. No sane person is buying right now because all of the demand is coming from short sale contracts ending. the hedge funds are contractually obligated to buy stocks at the end of the short and there were so many of these that future demand exceeded over 100% of available stock. The value isnt coming from the value of GME as a company, its coming from the expected demand of the GME stocks as a limited commodity with contracts requiring it's purchase.

AME may still undergo a bigger squeeze, you could also lose everything you invest.

There likely won't be a repeat of these events for a long long time. Retail investors causing an intentional short squeeze is now going to be a consideration for future short position decision making, and competing hedge funds will now seek to exploit this market condition if it's noticed in the future. This specific event will likely wind up being taught in college economics classes.</text>

    <text>“Buy the dip” means that, when/if the price of a share of a company decreases in value, you buy more of that stock at its cheaper price. 

“Hold” in the situation of what’s going on with WSB, is to keep from selling the shares of a company that you own. Selling shares of a company can decrease the value of a particular stock, and with WSB, the community wants the price of a stock to stay high. 

Some large financial firms that manage huge sums of money on Wall Street are buying and selling stocks; some of them made a bet that GameStop was going to decrease in value, with the goal of the company going into bankruptcy and driving the stock price to zero. Reddit users fought against that and started buying shares in order to increase the stock price and force the big financial firms into losing their bets BIG. VERY BIG. If people started selling their stocks (not holding), the price would go down and the big financial firms would lose less money, or potentially start making money.</text>

    <text>Yeah. Some of these people are holding on until the very end, because they don't care if they lose the money they put into the GameStop stock, they're more interested in trolling Wall Street. Others are just going to keep refusing to sell in the hopes of getting a really high payout.   


There were several other companies, like AMC, that WallStreetBets have also been focusing their efforts on, and which have also had similar results.</text>

    <text>This will probably harm some pension funds too.

However

Every pension fund administrator will have his or her client funds spread across dozens of different investment funds and managers. There will be hedge funds, growth funds, real estate trusts, small caps, industry funds....the list goes on. Even if a hedge fund goes under because of a short squeeze, the impact on any one pension fund will be limited as long as the fund administrator wasn't a total carrotbrain.</text>

    <text>Disclosure and nothing else really. The whole point of an hedge fund is to hedge your risk, but at that scale you can "manipulate" the market - just not with the same extent these investors are doing. What's going on with GME is not manipulation either, its just a massive bubble fueled by limited knowledge of securities trading and hype. 

Even before this, notable figures have caused manipulation in the market without intending so. Think about the Warren Buffet effect. In 2009 when financials were getting the hardest, whichever banks Warren put money in, saw a more favorable response from the general investor community. Was he manipulating the market? Not really. But the effects were the same.</text>

    <text>The risk managers at these firms generally use option contracts to manage their risk and essentially set a backstop for their potential liability.

That having been said, it's hard to say how much they're covered in a situation where a stock has been shorted as hard as GME and by a hedge fund who seem to play fast and loose with the rules (even by industry standards)

Without utilizing some kind of strategy to limit risk, the loss potential is inifnite.</text>

    <text>Let's think about the "intentions" of selling stocks. Let's say you own a small business, and you have a product or service you think is really great and will earn a bunch of money.

Unfortunately, you might not have the resources to realise your ambitions. What you need are "investors", people who are willing to buy into your vision. These people need motivation though, so you agree that you will make them part owners of the enterprise and you will share the profits and they can "democratically" influence how the company operates.

Now you have the money to make your vision a reality and off you go, you make your profit, they make their profit, and everybody wins. Unless, of course, your product or service sucks - so if you're an investor it's pretty much buyer beware.

At least, this is how it was "intended", and pretty much how it is marketed to the masses. It enables entities of all sizes to innovate and compete and society as a whole wins.

But what hasn't been widely acknowledged in the marketing of stock markets (until stories like this hit the media) is that there are "additional practices" happening behind the scenes that most likely weren't part of the original intent of investing, but were taken advantage of by those who saw a way to make a quick buck. Shorting is one of them.

The original concept of investing is an entirely benign and advantageous one, but the modern reality is far removed from the original intent and the fact that so many have no real understanding of these "additional practices" just demonstrates that the intent is far removed from the reality. If we go by intent, then the concept of shorting and the highly speculative mature of investing seems just plain wrong. 

Investors should have a relationship with the entity they are investing in and have a shared willingness to make the entity successful. Having other parties undermine these entities is an exercise not far removed from gambling and profiteering is counter-intuitive to the whole concept of investing.

Many produce justifications for these "additional practices", but those justifications are generally flimsy and with little substance... And often without merit. But they have become part of the modern lexicon so trying to convince them otherwise would be especially difficult - especially if they perceive it will come between them and an opportunity to profit.</text>

    <text>The hedgefunds do govern other people's money.

But the people who run these funds were using the money to manipulate the market. In this case, they were shorting the GME stock to produce an artificially large supply, expecting the added supply to hurt demand. As in, extra supply will make the price drop, which scares investors away dropping the price even more.


However they were wrong with their prediction, they shorted the stock over double the amount of real shares out there. And investors responded by buying all the added shorts and then more. They deserve to go bankrupt for their attempts to manipulate a stock, usually they are successful when they manipulate the market and usually they screw everyone else over</text>

Melvin shorted like 120-140% of the stock. That's insanity. It's so reckless, risking billions for like a $5 margin. They made the decision to be on the hook. All anyone at WSB had to do was notice. You can't be 50ft out of position and then complain you got scored on.</text>

    <text>This is what is called a “short squeeze” 

Wealthy people bet the stock would go down. This is a short. This is important because even if it a stock is shorted, shares must be purchased.

There was a “low float” on the stock. This means there was a low number of shares to purchase. This effects the price because low supply/high demand = high prices

High shorting ratio + low float = price rally. People recognized this and purchased shares anticipating a rally. After this point, r/WallStreetBets realized the potential and joined in. Now it turned into a movement against the wealthy people who bet the stock would go down. 

If it wasn’t for Reddit, this would not be as huge.</text>

    <text>Great question that I don’t know the answer to, but I wanted to add that there are repercussions outside of hedge fund managers like you said.

The founder of Melvin capital is a minority owner in the Charlotte bobcats. So it’s very likely Michael Jordan is heavily invested with them. The GOAT might lose some cash</text>

    <text>Stocks represent fractional ownership of a company, entitling you to that much of their profits.

Say I want to start up a factory that makes and sells widgets. In order to do that, I need to buy various parts of widget making machines, which are expensive, like $1 million expensive. I have, oh, $200,000 of my own money to spend, which obviously isn't enough. I can also borrow money from the bank, but they don't want to risk giving me more than $500,000. So where am I going to get another $300k to be able to afford the widget making machine I need?

I can sell *stock*. I can ask people to "crowd-fund" my factory in return for a cut of the profits. If you give me $100, I'll give you 1/10,000th of my company. If my factory makes $10 million dollars next year, you'll get a check for $1000! This money that goes out is called *dividends*. If I sell enough stocks, I get the money I need for the widget machine! Anyone who buys these stocks is a *stockholder* for my company.

However, since stock represents ownership, that also means if you own stock you get to vote on decisions for what the company does. Say my factory takes off and I made a bunch of money. I can either pay that money out as dividends...*or* I can *not* pay dividends and instead use it to buy a newer, bigger, faster widget machine and have twice the profit next year. Since you own part of the company, you get to have a say in which decision I make.

Except, no, you don't, because you only own 1/10,000th of the company. Your vote probably won't amount to much. You *could* buy many more stocks, so you own more of the company, but you probably can't buy enough. Moreover, as the owner I'm smart and I won't sell more than 49% of the ownership. That way, it doesn't matter if *everyone* who owns stock votes against me, I control 51% of the company so my one vote outweighs all of yours.

But what if it doesn't? That's where a board of trustees comes in. They're a committee of people elected to make decisions on behalf of the stockholders to make sure the company does what's best for them. This can include hiring or firing the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) who is the person who runs the company (if the owner is not also the CEO). As an example, a few years ago Papa John of Papa John's Pizzas said some stuff publicly that made the company look bad. He has ownership of a *lot* of the company, but not more than 50% and the board of trustees out-voted him to remove him as the CEO. He still has his ownership and can still vote, and he still takes his cut of the profits, but he's not in charge anymore.

The price of a share (which is a piece of stock) is, of course, determined by how much people are willing to spend to buy it. At the most fundamental level, that amount depends on how much the person expects to get back in dividends and how much risk they're willing to take. If the company fails and disappears, you will get nothing. Companies that are obviously doing well will see their stock prices rise; companies doing poorly will see them fall. Alternatively, you can get value from your stock by selling it to someone else who believes the dividends will be worth whatever you're selling them for. Or, you could sell them to someone who believes someone else will buy them so that they can sell them to someone else else who believes the dividends will be worth it, and so on.

Once the stock is sold by the company, their part in it is kind of done. They got the money they were going to get from it. However, if there is a lot of stock left over (say the founder only sold a total of 20% of the ownership) they can always sell more stock if they need cash. For example, my very expensive widget machine breaks unexpectedly, and that means I need money to buy a new one. I don't have enough money for that, but I *do* have plenty of extra stock so I can sell some of that and get the cash I need. Higher stock prices mean I get more cash for less stock. Alternatively, companies can buy back stocks so that they don't have to pay out dividends, or to regain control over the company.</text>

    <text>If I make a big company, I might want people to invest money in it. They'll pay the company, and in exchange I make them a partial owner. I give them a slip of paper that says they are a Shareholder, a part owner of the company. They get to vote on important matters for the company's future. If the company does really well, the shareholders might get a cut of the profit too. 

So a lot of people invest in particular companies, and become shareholders. But if a company isn't doing very well, they may sell or trade that stock in a company for a different one, a company they think will do better. So there's a whole system of people who buy and sell their partial ownerships in companies, trying to make money by buying the companies that they believe will make more money in the future, and sell the companies that they think are going to lose money.</text>

    <text>Thanks! So a very yolo option means that the seller hedges little, but if it starts looking like itll pan out they scramble to buy? And then when the thing expires theres another round of buying? So a gamma squeeze would allow one investor to sort of magnify the impact of their spending on stock price in a squeeze?

    <text>Hmm. The way I understand it is. 

Johnny Farmer Boy has 1 Apple worth $30. 

Hedge Boy says I'll borrow your Apple and pay you back with a brand new Apple in one week. Hedge Boy thinks apples suck and will only be worth $5 in a few days and tells his Big Money friends so they get ready to start rumours about apples sucking. 

They sell the Apple to the market at the current $30 with plans to buy it back a few days later after they convince everyone Apples suck and are only worth a crappy $5. They would make $25 in profit while driving Johnny Farmer Boy's farm bankrupt. 

Reddit comes in and says fuck you I like Johnny Boy's apples and his farm rocks. They keep buying Apples and the market price goes up to $1000 per Apple because everyone wants Apples and there's not enough. 

Hedge Boy and his friends are shitting their pants now because they no longer have the Apple and now need to buy a new one to return it to Johnny Boy by next week. The only Apples available are now worth $1000 so they end up losing a ton of money. 

Now imagine thousands of Apples are in play. Hedge Boy and his friends are losing millions and they are doing everything they can to save themselves and screw Reddit</text>

    <text>Where are you confused?

You borrow a stock from someone. Sell it now at a high price, buy it back later when it's low. You get money. This doesn't work when the price goes up, like what is happening with this.

They borrowed stock from rich people. The borrowed stocks are on interest, so they owe them MORE stocks than they borrowed originally.

Their execs who own stock are benefiting, but their business itself is dying (which is the source of this whole thing).

&gt;who are the ones losing

The big hedge funds who shorted GME. They bet on GME doing poorly, but GME instead skyrocketed in value.

&gt;are the people who bought gamestop going to get / getting tons of money?

Yes, the people who were in early (bought around $15/$20 a share) have already made tons of money. The people who are buying right now *may* get money, it all depends on if it goes up more or.</text>

    <text>Generally it's handled by the brokerage.  They're taking on the risk and getting the interest that are supposed to offset that risk.  Plus a some extra for the trouble.

    <text>The lender is lets say a large asset manager that has index funds, lets say blackrock. Blackrock has millions of shares of every company just sitting in their baskets. The index funds yield a sliver of management fee per year. To make some extra profit Blackrock can lend out the stocks they hold for their clients. They lend the stock for a nice fee per day and wait for their return. This is good for blackrock for multiple reasons: 1. Individual stocks dont have a large sway over the index so there isnt much risk 2. The short selling shares wont make a noticeble dent in the share price on their own 3. Stocks tend to go up 4. If the stock goes up blackrock and its clients will still just profit from the rise. 

To summarize: blackrock has slim to no risk and does have upside. Clients pay less for their index funds because the costs are paid by securities lending. So no real down side really</text>

    <text>&gt; what the benefit for the lender is.

It's a loan -- they charge interest.  Just like when you want to buy a house and you get a mortgage.  

They assume some risk (that you won't be able to pay), and they charge you interest to offset the risk, plus some amount for profit or servicing the loan.

You offer up collateral for the loan to offset some of the risk  -- in a mortgage, the house itself.  With short selling, other assets in your portfolio.</text>

    <text>The hedge funds are losing. They "shorted" the stock- which means they bet on it decreasing in value. 

For example- company ABC is worth $10 per share. You think it is going to lose value over the next month, you can say "I promise to sell you 100 shares of ABC at $5 per share in 1 month." 

So your 1 month is up and Company ABC is worth $100 per share. You still have to sell those 100 shares for $5. So you buy 100 shares for $10k and then immediately fulfill your contract by selling them at the agreed upon price.

The hedge funds did this to GameSpot. They actually promised to sell more shares than are available. GameSpot surged after a subreddit saw the hedge fund's tactic.  Since the price didn't drop to $0.50 and instead surged to $300, those hedge funds are stuck buying millions of shares at $300 and then selling them for their promised $0.25.</text>

    <text>The lender gets paid interest for each day the equity is lent. For someone who doesn't care about short term moves in the market and is holding the stock long-term, it's a way to generate additional income.

ELI5 verison:

John receives a PS5 for his birthday, but because he has a huge test coming up he knows he won't be able to play it for a few months.

His buddy Dave sees that PS5's are selling for a ridiculous amount of money and thinks the price will have to drop. He asks John to borrow his PS5 for a few months and he'll return a PS5 that's the exact same condition to him. In return he'll pay him interest.

John agrees and Dave sells the PS5 for $1,500. A few months later Dave buys a new PS5 for $500 and gives the PS5 and $X in interest to John (single payment for simplicity)

Dave pockets $1500 - $500 - $X, while John gets his PS5 back and $X in interest.

John lent out his PS5 b/c he got paid interest and he had no plans to get rid of it in that time period anyways.</text>

    <text>Typically most people don't make the active choice to lend their stock out to short sellers. That's often done by your broker, often times without you even knowing. Lending stock can be done at a fee, so the broker (and maybe even you, the owner of the stock) can get a reward for that risk.</text>

    <text>Shorting isn't. It's basically the "checks and balances" of the stock market. It ensures that overvalued companies get called out and their stock price returns to what their price should be.

The issue here, in this instance, was that they shorted 140% of a company's stocks (so, shorted more stock than what was actually available), on a company that wasn't actually valued too high in the first place. Retail traders noticed this and decided to buy when it went ridiculously low, so when it returns to the right price they profit.

Of course, there was a huge backlash this level of shorting took place to begin with and started massively buying up stock as a fuck you.</text>

I also don't understand how they stopped people buying more stock, but you're still allowed to sell? Who's buying the stuff people (if anyone) are selling, if you're not allowed to buy? I'm confused.

Basically. Okay. Gamestop as a company buys old games from people and sells them in a used condition to new buyers. A little like a pawn shop, a lot like blockbuster around 2007. The new game counsel playstation 5 was released around Christmas, and behold: technology has moved on from physical copies of DVDs. The game creators can now release downloads straight to your counsel. There's no need for physical dvds anymore. 

This would make gamestop obsolete. Like blockbuster. 

So the hedge fund Marvin Capital bet that gamestop as a company was going to lose a lot of value, possible even bankrupt. They talked about it on CNBC and elsewhere as almost a guaranteed thing. The stock was around 12-14 dollars at the time.

Over a year and a half ago a redditor saw this coming. U/deepfuckingvalue . He put a thesis out, it was well thought out. He thought it could cause a gamma squeeze in January of 2021. So some redditors got on board with him, but not a lot. And then this thesis started coming true. I started paying attention late December and was like well done! By the 1st and 2nd week of January I was looking at buying myself. And then it went viral and the rest is history.</text>

    <text>Not an expert but I think that's correct. The number of shares shorted was higher than the number of shares that actually exist (130% or something?) and it seems to be publicly available. Since more shares are shorted than what exists I think that makes a short squeeze easier to achieve.</text>

    <text>The market has trading hours because when you buy and sell stocks, you’re not buying an item off the shelf...but buying the stock from some other person somewhere in the world.   If there was trading 24/7, and a bunch of buyers all go out to dinner, then the only sellers left might be a small minority.  Suddenly there is scarcity because there aren’t sellers who have inventory to sell to you.  

So we designate hours.  The market is open from 9-4.  This allows us to coordinate buyers with sellers all at once.

Edit: just realized I didn’t answer the after hours thing.

So after hours trading was introduced so that people who wanted to take the risk of trading when most of the sellers have gone home, do so in after hour trading.  So after hour trading were instituted by the markets. But these hours are inherently riskier and you’re likely to get worse deals.   But there are brokers that will allow a retail trader (the average joe) to trade in after hour trading.</text>

    <text>Thank you for your insight. I stated in another comment I’m only looking to help the fight and drive the share price up a bit more, definitely not trying to make money. Though it does seem like this may be less of a good idea than I originally intended by other comments. I will probably try paper trading like /u/tryhardfit suggested before I throw any big bucks out.</text>

    <text>Lets say i bought something from you. The check is in the mail. So you havent **settled** our sale yet but you take that money and buy something else. You turn around and sell that to someone else who also says they will mail you a check. If everything lines up you should be fine but what if it doesnt? This *free riding* (i think) is one of many things that can go sideways.</text>

    <text>Think of the market as a list of prices people are willing to buy things for, and prices people are willing to sell things for.

During the day when someone is willing to buy a thing for the same price someone is willing to sell a thing, the deal is made and ownership changes. There isn't really ever a real price, there's just a kind of average of prices people are willing to buy for and sell at, to get an idea of what the trend is. 

During the night people can still record their offers, though. So the average prices can still move as people record their intent. But, no one is actually making deals, it's just intention. When the market opens again, any deals still on the books can now be made by the traders again.

So, if your offer to buy still matches with someone's offer to sell in the morning, then the deal will be made and you will then get ownership, but if by morning there is no one willing to sell for your buying price then the order will just sit there and you won't get any stocks.</text>

    <text>I’m no expert but as day trading is very risky they regulate it.  Yo can buy and sell on the same day (day trading) but if you do more that 3 day trades (within a week) you are considered a ‘pattern day trader’ and you are required to have minimum $25,000 in your trading account at any time.  If you only do 3 day trades a week you can trade with any amount, for example $100.  No min. Balance in you account is required.

Edit.  It’s over 3 trades a week.</text>

    <text>After hours trading is just as real as normal hours trading. It is a semi-arbitrary cut off that is designed to ensure high liquidity. Basically, as general rule, high liquidity players don't trade EXT so you assume extra liquidity and volatility risks. 

Nothing wrong with it, though, as long as you're okay with it. I trade EXT regularly. You can find some sweet deals in the weasel back alley when the lights dim 😉

And yes, of course you own any shares when an order fills. Technically, transactions take a day or two to get processed by a clearing house no matter when you trade. You can see in your account for example when transactions are "settled". For most practical purposes, you can ignore these details.</text>

    <text>What is a put: An investor says to a company or broker "Hey, If I give you $X right now will you agree to let me sell you up to V quantity of W stock any time in the next Y days at $Z price?"

----

ex: Bananas are currently $1 each but I think the price of bananas will fall soon. I have a friend who needs bananas and might go to the grocery store soon. I tell them "Hey, if I give you $0.50 right now will you agree to buy up to 12 bananas from me for $0.85 any time in the next week?" They agree. 

4 days later bananas are on sale for $0.65 I buy 12 and force my friend to buy them from me for $0.85 each. All said and done I profit $1.90.

Or if banana prices rise I just don't buy and and I'm only out the $0.50 I paid to set up the agreement.</text>

    <text>Pretty complicated scenario at work here but basically these hedge fund managers borrowed a bunch of GameStop stock and then "sold" the stock between $15-30 each. Now they have to return the stock. Since it was previously "sold", the hedge fund managers now have to re-purchase the same stock at whatever the current price is, which is sitting at about $300 per share right now. Subtract the difference 300-30= -$270 per share. Now multiple a $270 loss per stock by the number of stocks they have to return, which is likely in the millions.  So yes LOTS of money in GameStop. 

They cannot "just stop" investing as they have to live up to their end of the bargain and return the stocks they borrowed.

I hope this makes sense!</text>

    <text>Hedge funders short sold the GameStop stock, a lot.

What certain stock traders can do is borrow stock from a broker and give it back later.

They borrow some stock when it's $50 a share and sell it immediate. They borrow 100 shares and sell for $50 each. $5,000 return.

They're betting that the price will go below $50 a share. Lo'behold, it is now worth $40 a week later. They buy 100 shares at $40 a share for $4,000 and give them back to the broker.

They have made $1000 profit.

Now when a lot of people are selling stock of a company, the price falls to reflect the increased supply of stock on the market. Seeing the price fall makes others sell their stock, too, to protect their investments.

Thing is, if you're a big fund and you can borrow more than 100 shares. You could borrow 10,000 shares. If you start dumping lots of shares into the market, you can make the price tank along with it, fulfilling your "bet" that the price will go lower. You can, through sheer force, make the price fall low enough for you to profit from massively.

In this case, 100% of the stock was shorted. All of it. That's a ridiculous amount of shorted stock and exactly how these guys got caught doing it.

What happens now is thousands of redditors, maybe millions, are all holding stock and not selling. This is going to make the hedge funders increasingly desperate to buy stock that they need to give back to the brokers. Hence this "hold the line" mentality. The longer reddit holds out, the higher price will go.

Had the funds not been greedy they'd've never have been caught. Now they have, Reddit has reverse manipulated the market to ensure the funds lose their bet that the price will fall.

The hedge funders are about to get spanked, for a change.</text>

    <text>You put in calls which are tallied after hours, basically think of it like people lining up outside a store before it opens, same premise. When the store/stockmarket opens... people go in and buy their stuff/shares.

The calls themselves are tracked and tallied through the existing exchange system, just because the market closes doesn't mean all the computers shut off, they just can't exchange any shares/cash till it has opened.

It's silly.... I don't understand why the market simply isn't open 24/7.</text>

    <text>And the hedge funds didn't even have the stocks.  They wrote a contract stating they were going to sell shares at $20 that they didn't actually own.  They bet the price would go down by the sell date allowing them to buy at a lower price and immediately sell for the contracted $20.

However, the Reddit investors caused the stock price to go up.  Now, the hedge funds need to buy stock at $300 just to sell it at the contracted price of $20.</text>

    <text>This is in the realm of derivatives. Let's say lemons cost $1.50 today. A lemon seller who tells you that lemon prices might fall to $1 next week. And then there are people who need lemons next week and will pay $2 per lemon.

Being the genius that you are, you can tell that you could earn $1 in free money just by being the middleman. So you tell the lemon buyers that you can sell them $2 lemons next week. They buy 1 million lemons. And you'll be getting $1m in free money next week.

That's theoretically how it goes. But in this case, r/wallstreetbets decides to mass buy lemons and causes lemon prices to increase to $3 instead. Now, you're stuck with a promise to sell a million $2 lemons. You have no lemons in stock and you're now forced to buy $3 lemons to sell at $2. You make a loss of $1 million. This could have been averted if you just bought $1.50 lemons a week earlier, but you were greedy, and wanted to buy cheaper lemons for double profit. And now it backfired on you.

And now it stops being ELI5. You double down and persuade all of your lemon owning friends to dump all of their lemon inventory worth billions in the market at $1.50 betting that r/wallstreetbets doesn't have to money to buy them all. Unfortunately, they do have the money to buy up every last lemon and lemon prices are still at $3. Your friends are very angry at you since they could've sold their lemons at $3 and you cheated them into selling them at $1.50. But you manage to persuade them that it's not your fault that they lost money, and it's actually the fault of r/wallstreetbets for "ruining" the lemon market. Your friends buy your excuse.

**For a very ELI5**, it's essentially a casino game where players gamble whether lemon prices will officially drop below $1 next week. Hedge funds chose "yes". r/wallstreetbets chose "no". On paper, it's 50/50, but there's another metagame where extra money is important for bribing the dealer into helping you out. Right now, r/wallstreetbets is the side with more money.</text>

    <text>Two ways:
1. Make everyone stop contributing to the stock market. Withdraw all their funds, stop contributing to IRAs and 401k, and withdraw it all. That way the cronies won't be able to utilize our money for their gain.

2. To repeat $GME, find a stock with high "short interest" and get a large pool of people to buy the stock and hold. Spread the word for people to keep buying. Increasing the demand will increase the price. If the price goes high enough, it will screw over those hedge fund cronies who bet against the stock cause they want it to go bankrupt so they can make their billions.</text>

The thing that's actually bad here is that shorting is very high risk and crybaby hedgefunds are complaining and potentially colluding with money makers and Brokerages to cover their ass.

If you open a short position and it screws u over it should be your fault bc you accepted the high risk the second u entered the trade. As long as this idea applies to EVERY PLAYER on the market than there is absolutely nothing wrong with shorting. Every type of trade can be used for good and bad. Its only bad tho of u're on the losing end lol</text>

Some greedy company called melvin (don't know full name) borrowed it's shares. Sold em. And when the prices fall even more down, they would buy em back and pay what they owe while having done some profit. However instead of falling down, the prices rose cuz Redditors united and bought many shares. So now the greedy company is fucked i would say lol. Still you could do some digging yourself.

    <text>The trap is short selling.

Short selling is when you *borrow* a stock thinking it will go down and sell it right away.  Then if you're right you buy another stock later for a lower price and return it.  You pocket the difference.

HOWEVER.

If you're wrong you lose money by buying it back after it rises.

The firms did ALOT of this.  So much that it's virtually impossible now to get out of it due to WSB not selling.</text>

    <text>There is definitely a possibility for negative consequences. It’s kind of like an ecosystem. A bunch of different plants and animals all live in the same space, and compete for resources (food, water, etc.). Normally, everything is at equilibrium. If the predator population gets too large, they’ll over-hunt the prey to a point where some predators starve. This gives the prey population a chance to rebound, until there are so many of them that predators have an easy time of it and their numbers go up. There’s an ebb and flow, winners and losers, but it’s generally stable.

Now imagine something happens to disrupt this balance. A wildfire burns down all the prey’s food sources. Chronic wasting disease starts killing off predators. The prey manipulates the stock market and costs the predators $70 billion dollars. Everything will probably recover, eventually, but the animals might have to evolve in new directions to compensate. Maybe it’s so bad that they never recover. The world is too unpredictable to know.

You don’t have to care about the isolated event that a bunch of hedge funds lost money. I don’t either. That said, I am slightly worried about how the market will evolve in response to this event. Will the government institute new regulations that screw over poor people? Will hedge fund investors change their practices and become more predatory? Will we forget about this in two weeks and escape without any long-term consequences? The world is too unpredictable to know.</text>

    <text>Long story short they made a bet that gamestop stock price would decrease in time. 

The bet would allow them to make a profit of the difference between the price they started at, and the price it finishes at on some date. The lower the final price, the more profit.

The problem is that a stocks price can only go down to zero. So there is a finite amount of profit to be made. However, a price can go up infinitely (not really but whatever), so there is no cap on how bad this bet can go for them. 

Reddit called their bluff, and now they are doing everything they can to lie cheat and steal their way out of paying up. You and I aren't supposed to have a say in their 1%er games. The stock market is their casino, not ours.</text>

    <text>Hedge funds did a so called "short" bet. That means they can sell the a stock at a certain point in time for a certain price. If the actual stock price is below this price at the time they make profit. Therefore they try to manipulate the price down, reddit tries to push it up as this will hurt the hedge funds and make profit for the private investors, as they need to buy the stocks to fulfill their "short" deal.</text>

    <text>In my eyes I probably would see the economy doing better with out hedge funds that engage in these extremes of shorting business stocks more than exists. At that point they are the ones that want a business to fail and quite possibly be the ones that trigger it’s end. Shorting if done for good would be that someone does their research on a business and finds something like a scam/lie about their product what ever it may be. You would then short because you would expect the businesses price to go down after people start finding out about the negative practices.</text>

    <text>It's not bad in itself it's the way it's done by hedge funds. 
They're big enough that anouncing they're shorting a stock will cause the stock to dip, earning them money. 
It is very close to market manipulation, so not very popular.</text>

    <text>It depends on the hedge fund. Reddit, the know it alls of dunning kreuger hill, think only billionaires use hedge funds. But the truth is plenty of large scale retirement accounts do as well. The retirement funds for teachers and firefighters, and you, might be tied up in and around such funds. This is actually a lot of money too.

Hopefully they're not in this stupid fund though, as usually they like safe investments, which mass shortsellers are not.</text>

    <text>It’s not bad, per se. To me it just feels weird to make money on something that loses its value. Mostly because it’s SO far disconnected from the initial ‘a share is an investment in a company, a tiny bit of co-ownership’ idea of stock trading that it just feels like gambling, but gambling with things that affect real people’s lives potentially in very harsh ways.

The ‘scam’ may refer to regular people being locked out of buying GameStock shared right now (on certain platforms) cause the big players are losing too much money. That’s essentially illegal market manipulation but they’re the big players so they get to do it...</text>

    <text>Those firms did the opposite of investing in GameStop. They borrowed shares to sell them short, betting that the price would go down. When you short, your potential losses are unlimited, because there's no (theoretical) limit to how much the price can go up.</text>

    <text>You would need to go into greater detail to get any proper answers. 

In fact, there isn’t really any proper answers, as nobody knows and if we did, we’d all be rich.

A few basic questions to do one’s best assessing the risk to your relative’s wealth would be the time horizon involved with her investments, the % of loss rather than just “$8000”, and the sort if investments or even exactly what she is invested in.

Also... the point of your financial advisor is to be pestered. That’s part of their job. :)</text>

    <text>Here is how my financial advisor convinced us not to pull our money when the market was tanking at the start of COVID (and thank goodness we didn’t!):

Look at the history of the stock market. It ALWAYS goes up. Even after times of great financial disaster, it WILL go back up. Investing is a long-term deal. Unless you NEED to start pulling money soon, then just keep your money in, and it will recover, even if it’s scary to lose so much in the moment.</text>

    <text>Well, shorting is legal yes. But it makes money for the shorter seller when a company loses value, instead of normal investing which makes money when a company gains value. So the seller gets rich when a company fails (or at least, gets less valuable) which has repercussions for both the employees of that company and the wider stock market, since short sellers have a clear interest in companies not being successful.</text>

    <text>The problem is that they didn’t own the stocks—they borrowed them from person A to sell immediately to person C, hoping to buy them back at a lower price so that they can return them to person A. The price has gone up from where they sold them initially, so in order to buy back the stock to return, they have to pay through the nose—meaning they’re out the difference, which is potentially infinite.</text>

    <text>I don't know who says Friday is a deadline or why it would be other than margin calls.

Say you have $20 in your account.   You borrow short 1 share of a $20 stock thinking jt will go down.  Instead the stock goes to $200 for whatever reason.  The brokerage may issue a margin call which is saying you have 2/3 days to deposit at least $180 to keep this position.  If you close the position, buy to cover at 200, you still owe 180 to get to zero.

If you're in the negative a lot like that or the time passes without extra funds or at any point between the brokerage cam decide to buy to cover for you whenever they want at whatever the market price is at that time.  You now owe them whatever money.  This is why it's not possible to just wait out a big manipulation that's sure to drop back down and how losses can become infinite. 

Example, a $200 short on gme could have cost people, just in a day could have not just taken someone's 2000 out but they would have also owed 30,000 more to the broker. 

Amateur traders have found themselves in hundreds of thousands of dollar debt when trying to trade with a few thousand dollar account.  

The market is not simple in any regard.  Don't get lottery eyes when something like this week happens.  You're far more likely to lose.</text>

    <text>There’s no deadline for Friday. The short sellers don’t have a deadline to buy back the shares. Problem for them is, they pay more each day as the stock price rises.

    <text>The best way to consistently make money in the stock market is to put it in a diverse group of companies and wait 20+ years. Shit happens. There’s ups and downs. In the long run though, the market has always gone up. That’s what she should be betting on. As you approach retirement, you transition to less volatile investments so that a sudden down swing doesn’t screw you right when you’re ready to cash out. Until then, you can’t worry too much about fluctuations that are largely beyond your control.

The market will go up. If there comes a time when the market is no longer growing over time on average, we will probably have much bigger issues.</text>

    <text>You didn't fully spell it out, so I'll reiterate: the $100 went to the person who was selling for $200 when I **had** to buy from someone to fulfill my obligation.

So you (the person who loaned the card out) don't care about the price, and the money went to the seller who was selling for $200. They made $200, and I made $100 when I sold your card, but spent $200 buying the new one, essentially coming out to me having lost $100 overall.</text>

    <text>They bet that Gamestop would lose value, and borrowed shares from lenders. They then sold these shares at current value, betting that the shares would be cheaper in a couple weeks, they could buy the shares back for cheap, repay the lender, and profit the difference. 

Problem is, that depends on the shares dropping. WSB saw this going down and started buying up the stock. Increased interest drives the price up. If they hold onto their shares, the short-sellers have no choice but to buy from them in order to repay the lender. Unfortunately for the short-sellers, the price is now far above what they originally sold their shares for. Melvin already sold their shares for $xx, that's all the money they could possibly get out of this situation. The stock is now worth $XXX, which Melvin HAS TO pay when they are FORCED to repay the lenders. 

The longer WSB holds, the more desperate Melvin gets, the more the shares are worth.</text>

    <text>Roughly speaking, wall street bet against gamestop, aka shorted it. If the stock goes down a dollar, they are paid a dollar by people who took that bet. If it goes up a dollar, they lost a dollar. End game is that they have to pay the diff on Friday. 

Layer 2 is that they overshorted. If ten stocks exist, they said they'd bet on 14. So they have to buy stock on Friday regardless of the price. If it's 500 a sharethen too bad, they have to buy it. This is why the stock has "infinite value".</text>

    <text>Basically one of two paths, depending on the person buying the shares:

Greedy: one of the risks of shorting a stock is that in theory there’s no limit to how much money you can lose. If you short a stock when it’s at 10 expecting it to go to 5, and then the price jumps, you are contractually obligated to buy a share back and return it, regardless of where the price is. 

When this all started, there were significantly more short sales outstanding than actual shares in circulation, so anyone who grabbed a bunch and held on would be able to dictate terms to the short sellers if they could just control enough of the available stock. Thee greedy ones are hoping for the price to rise even more out of control, and since the short sellers haven’t cut their losses to any serious degree, it might happen. 

Lols: the other buyer in this scenario thinks the money is a nice bonus but primarily heard about a bunch of day traders destroying hedge funds and wanted to help.  They either didn’t throw in enough money to really effect their situation, or are so disillusioned they just don’t care if they lose too much. 

Most people have a little of both of these, in my limited experience.</text>

    <text>Basically they borrowed more shares that exist on the market. So when the time comes to sell them (because they’ll be forced to) traders can get their own price because they control all the market. In theory they can put a sell at 10,000 (for example) and it will have to go through. So a $30 share can be sold for 10,000. End game is becoming hella rich and these billionaires going bust</text>

    <text>They *shorted* gamestop. They basically borrowed shares, then promised to buy the shares at a later date. That means if they borrowed them at a high price, and they buy the shares later to "pay them back" at a lower price, they make money off the stock dropping in value. Short selling is a way of gambling that the stock drops in value, that when you repay them the share in the future, it's cheaper to do so. It's kind of selling shares that you don't own, then purchasing them later to make up for that.

They can't "stop investing" in gamestop. They short sold it, so they "borrowed stock" and they promised to buy stock to replace the borrowed stock. Now everyone has dumped their money into GME and the stock rose in value like CRAZY, something like 10,000%. People (like all the randos from /r/wallstreetbets) bought and held shares in gamestop/GME, and now these people have to eventually buy the expensive shares and repay what they borrowed. They only have so much time to do so, so no, they can't "stop investing". They have to repay what they borrowed, and they borrowed at a low price and now it skyrocketed, so they're basically fucked.

And they borrowed more shares than exist of GME, about 140% of total shares. Comments above explain that - like if person B borrows a share from Person A (short selling), then Person B sells it to Person C, then Person D borrows it from person C, then Person D sells it... 2 shares were sold, but only 1 exists. So you can short sell more shares than exist, and in this case it was a bit extreme, and people noticed.

Someone correct me if there's anything wrong here</text>

Even if the individual stocks are “considered low risk”, there might not be enough of them or their returns are too correlated to provide sufficient diversification.

If this is her retirement fund, just remember that it’s a marathon not a sprint. There will be days with large losses and other days with large gains. Try not to focus on the outliers. Focus on the things she’s in control of - saving money, making money, and most of all enjoying life. Retirement savings might as well be a black box - just toss your money into ETFs and rest assured it’ll go up.</text>

    <text>This is a difficult question to answer. [here’s an excerpt from their terms of service](https://imgur.com/a/OD6owf2) saying they’re allowed to halt trading whenever they want to, but just because it’s in the ToS and people signed it, that doesn’t make it legally binding; as an exaggerated example, if they had in there that they could steal your life savings once you agree to the contract, they obviously still wouldn’t be allowed to do that. Very likely, this will be heavily investigated to find evidence of collusion, and that will be used to determine if this was illegal market fixing or not. It really comes down to the reason WHY they halted trading, not necessarily that they were able to. As another weird example, let’s say the super bowl is on and the chiefs are up 21-0 in the 4th quarter and it’s decided that the game will be postponed and finished another day. Is it because a lot of rich people bet on the Bucs to win it and they’re not happy, or is it because some crazy super storm is threatening to destroy the stadium? 

I don’t want to weigh in on my personal thoughts one way or another, but the fact that Citadel is the parent company of Robinhood - and they just bailed out Melvin Investments that was losing insane amounts of money on GameStop because of Wallstreetbets - is not a very good look. 

The end results of all of this though? Likely nothing. The fines they’d pay on the class action suit if it moves forward will be much, much less than the losses they would’ve sustained if they didn’t pause GME buying.</text>

    <text>Correct me if I’m wrong, but actively selling off masses of the „borrowed“ shares drives the price of the shorted company way down. Shorting is also not nearly as transparent as it should be, so possible other investors just see the stock continuously dropping and don’t buy in. Therefore basically guaranteeing the ruin of the (over-)shorted company.</text>

    <text>The idea is to hold until the shorts expire and the hedge funds are forced to purchase at inflated prices, and then sell.  The goal, as I see it, is to strategically time it so that the hedge funds are stuck holding the bag as the value plummets.  There are apparently huge interest rates on expired shorts, like a payday loan, and so if they can purchase stocks to pay back what they owe, they continue to lose on the interest.  Demand go up, supply go down, price increases.</text>

    <text>So suppose that the price is 50$ a share, now as it seems there's a lot of demand for this stock, which means there are a lot of buyers and not many people(sellers) willing to trade with the buyers. 
Now these buyers are willing to pay a higher price for their order.
Hence they will punch an order for say 60$, and once he gets a seller who willingly sells the share at 60$, the order gets executed.
Now when more and more shares are being traded at a higher price the price of share is increased, in this case from 50$ to 60$.
P.S- It's just a simple case, to explain in general how partial booking of shares takes place.</text>

    <text>So the hedge funds with shorts *have* to buy at some point. Multiple billions of dollars worth. When the price spikes from them finally giving in and buying, everyone else will be selling off the surge. Since they are being forced to buy, the price will stay high while the rest of us hopefully sell off. Selling off will drive down the price of course, but theoretically not at the rate at which it will be driven up by the short holders.</text>

    <text>It comes down to what people are prepared to buy and sell it at. So, for example, if I have a load of shares, I can say "I'll sell these at £100 per share". If someone else is selling them for £90 per share then a buyer will buy theirs before mine, and the price is £90 from then until the next transaction. If everyone else is selling for £110 per share, then mine will sell first and the price will be £100.

In general, there are always* lots of shares available for various prices, so the price drifts up and down depending on whether there are more people trying to buy or sell.

The more shares and requests available, the more stable the price is because the more purchases have to take place before the price shifts. 

There's also what's called "spread" which is the difference between the highest sell price (ie, what you'd get if you sold a share) and the lowest buy price (ie, what you'd pay if you bought a share) - this is normally very low, however when things are being weird, it can get quite high - I saw it at about $60 for GME yesterday, which was a third of the share value at the time. That's ... crazy, but was due to the market manipulation preventing normal buying. 

* Always isn't actually always, especially for less popular companies or when weird shenanigans are going on, like with GME at the moment, but generally if you want to buy something "normal", you can just go in and buy at close to the quoted price.

Hope that helps! Let me know if you want me to clarify anything.</text>

    <text>Simple answer: yes. Those who sell while the price is rising will make money. Those who sell while the price is falling will make money if they sell the shares for more than they bought them for. Those who wait too long will have to either hold the shares indefinitely and not "realize" their gain/loss or they'll sell below what they paid per share and lose the difference. There are some other complicating factors with the shorts and other investment options on GME right now but that's the basic idea for most retail investors.</text>

    <text>You have a bunch of bids wanting to buy N shares and M price, and you have a bunch of asks wanting to sell X shares at Y price.

Execute all the trades you can, matching up buyers and sellers, until all the bids are wanting to buy for a lower price than the lowest ask. 

The price is going to be in that narrow gap between the highest bid and the lowest ask.  I think the singular price reported is the price of the last trade executed.

Things get weird when there's no bids, or no asks, or the bids and asks are way far apart.  It'll still show a price but it's like... low precision, if that makes sense.  Which is why some stuff shows bid and ask price too.  It doesn't matter much for high volume stuff, but if you get into the weeds, it may be significant.</text>

    <text>No, the price is entirely related to the shorters being exposed and having to cover their bets. As soon as they have covered their bets the price of the stock should return to a price that is related to the worth of the company. 

It’s no longer about gamestop, it’s about the game of short selling and buying of stocks entirely.</text>

    <text>No single person or entity does this. The sellers and buyers of that stock do. Someone puts in an order saying they want to buy a certain stock at a certain price. Someone else puts in an order saying they want to sell a certain stock at a certain price. If the prices match, the sale goes through, and that is the price of the stock.</text>

    <text>Realistically, you do have to sell to make money. Normally, what gives shares in a stock their value is the money that the company will periodically send out to all shareholders (dividends), so keeping the shares over a long period of time will also turn into money as well. This is unlikely to happen with GameStop, though.</text>

    <text>Simplified:

GameStop was expected to lose value, so large investing firms borrowed a LOT of shares (more than actually exist) and sold them for the price at that time.

They have to buy them back which they were okay when the price was expected to drop.

People realized they were dependent on the price dropping and bought a lot of GameStop shares to create a demand for the stock to raise the price.

This means the big firms have to pay the larger price when they have to return the borrowed stock.

Which means they have to buy the stocks back that all of those people have bought and have now risen in price a lot.

People are expecting the price to rise A LOT more when the big firms start buying it up to "close their position", aka returning the borrowed stocks.

This isn't financial advice, just an explanation.</text>

    <text>Slightly long read. But here's the full story.

Short sellers led by Melvin capital short sold GME shares to such an extent that shorted shares were 140% of the available shares. 

How short selling works is, you borrow shares from an owner willing to lend his shares, and sell them because you expect share prices to drop in the future. The idea is to buy the same shares back in the future when they're cheaper, and return them to the owner, closing the trade. Meanwhile, you pay some interest until you've returned the shares. Your profit is (price of shares sold - price of shares rebought - interest cost paid).

Now because they've shorted more shares than actually exist, they've completely skewed the demand-supply ratio unnaturally and they're forced to buy them back at much higher rates. This is called a short squeeze and is entirely the fault of shorters overtrading.

Reddit's involvement is more coincidental. There's a guy called deepfuckingvalue (also has a yt channel called roaring kitty) who made a post in July 2019 saying GME is undervalued at $5/ share based on his fundamental analysis and he expects the price to hit maybe $40-50 in the next two years. Mostly he was targetting the console cycle in late 2020 which would increase share price due to cyclic revenue. Most of us downvoted or made fun of his monthly updates from that point. But a few triggers moved in GME's favor.

Michael Burry (The Big Short guy) thought the shares were undervalued too and bought a few %. Ryan Cohen of chewy.com bought 9% shares with an option to buy another 7% and has shown interest in helping it turn around GameStop into a more online business. Four of the existing directors are retiring this year and Cohen would look to replace them with his guys and assume more control over the company.

All of these gradually increased share price and deepfuckingvalue started to make a lot of money. From his initial investment of $50k, he reached $44.8 mil solely from GME shares and options yesterday. This caused a lot of other redditors to buy too and created buzz around it (I got in late Nov, because of the console sales).

Media and redditors themselves have been crediting redditors for this but it's really a combination of positive triggers (large investors coming in, prospect of Cohen led turnaround) and stupid risk management by short sellers which caused this squeeze and got prices to shoot up.</text>

    <text>The way I understand it, is there are a limited number of shares, nearly all are in the hand of retail traders. Due to the shorting, the hedge fund that started this all will have to buy, and they will have to do so from the people who have the stock at such a high price. If everyone holds, they will only be able to buy a few, and the demand will increase. If everyone holds long enough, the price could reach the thousands. That's trading firms having to buy at thousands of dollars, inch by inch as people break rank. We expect the bubble to break, and the firm's to have to absorb the losses. People are bound to miss the mark and loose money, but the hope is that the vast majority of the losses fall on Wallstreet</text>

    <text>The short sellers shorted 140% of all available stock. That means they have to buy back every single share floating with retail investor holders at whatever the asking price is, then there will still be able 10 million more shares that they'll have to cover by selling between each other. Upward price pressure will be applied the entire time. They will be willing to pay anything because they risk lose everything.</text>

    <text>Depends on the fund.  

Pensions are largely (though not entirely) gone, partly for this exact reason.  When the company is managing a retirement fund, they take the risk.  They decided to pass that risk on by offering 401k accounts instead.  Then the worker is taking the risk with their own retirement funds.  

If they've got 401ks and are invested in a hedge fund... caveat emptor.  If they've actually still got pensions... caveat emptor for the company.</text>

    <text>* Large financial institutions short sold huge amounts of a risky businesses stock
* To short sell you borrow a stock from an institution and sell it in the hopes that later you can buy the stock back at a lower price to return it to the person you borrowed it from, pocketing the difference
* Importantly, short selling *commits* you to buying that stock at a later date, so even if the price goes up you still have to buy it at some point at a loss
* Redditors noticed the large short position and reasoned that if they owned some of the stock then it would *have* to be bought off them at some point at a price they could dictate
* The increased buying activity caused the price to go up, so the original short sellers are now on the hook and will take losses
* Instead of simply accepting the loss, these investors *doubled down* by shorting the stock from this higher price in the hopes that the bubble would pop and they wouldnt lose so much
* The price continued to rise and the cycle continues</text>

    <text>you know how sometimes adults make the rules as they go? this is what happens on the stock market all the time. people with a lot of money, let's call them adults, can influence stock prices and with this influence they make money. of course, they don't just create money, the take money from small fish that cannot influence prices, let's call them kids.

one particular adult was doing this. one kid noticed and asked his friends to join so they can play this same game. through the power of reddit, a lot of kids got together and together they had so much money that they were also able to influence prices. they took money back from this particular adult.

now this adult, and all other adults, are losing and they are very sour because kids can get together to play  the same game. they are now doing illegal stuff to prevent kids from playing this game. and now the same kids are coming together and taking these adults to court because you cannot call foul play because you are losing.</text>

    <text>It also depends on what they shorted the stock at. In GameStop’s case, anyone shorting them is royally screwed. When most HFs put their short in the stocks was probably around 4-5 dollars with the expectation of it going down to close to zero, now it’s trading at 35.5. You don’t short a stock you expect to go up. At the end of the day, what will probably happen, is certain hedge funds will get back in at 40-50 (if they aren’t already) and then watch it crash back to earth once the hype is done and make a killing that way.</text>

    <text>You need to be an "accredited investor" to be allowed to invest with hedge funds so it's mostly other big institutions and the wealthy.

There have recently been reforms to make it easier for "Mom &amp; Pop" investors to get accredited and therefore allowed to buy into hedge funds though.

    <text>Normal (long) trades are where you buy a stock (part ownership in a company), then sell it at a later date.  If the price of the stock went up in the meantime, congratulations, you made money!  Theoretically if the stock price goes to infinity and you can sell those stocks, then you have infinity dollars.  On the other hand, if the price of the stock went down, you lost money.  If the company went out of business, you lost 100%.  

There is also something called shorting, which is like... taking out a loan, but instead of for money, it's for stocks.  Then you sell those stocks.  Later on, you buy those stocks back and return them to the guy who lent them to you.  In this scenario, you make money if the price of the stock goes *down*.  But the risk/reward here is reversed.  If the company goes out of business, you make 100%, but if the stock price goes towards infinity you can lose infinity dollars.

Okay, so GME is the ticker symbol for Gamestop.  Everybody and their mother is like "brick and mortar video games are fucking dead man, everything is online", so they borrow shares of gamestop and sell them (shorting), waiting for them to go out of business.  Or at least waiting for their stock price to drop further, so they can buy them for less, return the shares to the lender, and pocket the difference.

SOOO much gamestop stock was shorted, more than actually exists to be traded.  

Now the genius retards at /r/wallstreetbets realize that all these institutions shorting gamestop, they'll HAVE to buy those shares back to return to whoever lent it to  them, *no matter what the price is*.  So they collectively buy up every gamestop stock they can, until there's no more left to buy.  And that makes the price go up, from $5 to $10 to $20 to $40 to... over $400.  They want the price to go so high that the folks who lent gamestop shares to the short sellers will demand the borrowers (short sellers) return their stock to them.  

And if the short sellers do this, they'll ALSO be buying up any available gamestop stock, *at any price*.  So the price could skyrocket.  Thousands of dollars per share perhaps.  This could bankrupt multi-billion dollar companies.  

Those multi-billion dollar companies appear to be trying everything, including things that may not be legal, to derail this runaway train before they're wiped out.

Also, these multi-billion dollar companies are criminally stupid for putting themselves in this position.</text>

    <text>a limit order will be filled at the exact price you want a stop order will be filled at that price or more. 

So basically a limit order the market is able to see and once a buyer thinks thats a fair price they will buy it. a Stop order is not seen by the market and is triggered only after the price hits that amount so you may not actually sell at $10 it may be $11 or $12 by the time it sells.</text>

    <text>The hedge funds pay interest in the stocks they "rented". When the hedge funds can't pay that interest, or if they finally decide the stock won't tank so might as well but then, that's when they purchase the over priced stocks and the short squeeze begins.

    <text>Think of it like this - Person A lends a share to Person B. Person B sells it to Person C. Person C lends it to Person D. Person D sells it to Person E. Person E lends it to Person F who sells it to Person G.

Persons B, D, F each need to find a share to settle their loan, but only one share has been lent out.

The other way this can happen is by selling options. I can sell you a call option, which gives you the right to buy 1 share of GME tomorrow for $50. If the price of GME runs up past $50, you’re gonna exercise that option and make me sell you a share of GME for $50. My problem is that I have to find a share of GME to sell you. It’s a real problem for me if I don’t have any.</text>

    <text>Sure, might not be entirely correct but this is my understanding. If i've made a mistake feel free to correct me.

Investors have been attempting to short Gamestop's stock price. Shorting is a practice where you borrow a share from someone with the promise that you'll give it back to them after a certain fixed amount of time has passed. The investor then sells the borrowed share, and bets on the price going down. Later, they buy one share at a lower price to return it to the person they borrowed it from.

As an example, they are able to sell a share they don't own for $10, and buy the share back later for $1 after the price drops - pocketing the $9 difference. This entire plan hinges on the share price going down. This is the gamble.

The big kerfuffle is that private investors here on Reddit and elsewhere have seen what was happening, and have realised that they can make money by performing a short squeeze.

A short squeeze is where someone buys the stock being sold at $10 from the investor but - most importantly - doesn't sell it back later. Since the stock was borrowed, the original person *has* to purchase a share back to return it to the new owner, therefore they have to pay whatever the seller wants them to pay.

Now, instead of being able to buy the stock back at $1, they need to buy it back at $50, because the private investor won't sell it to them for less. The original investor loses $40 and the private investor gains $40.

This scenario has played out on a massive scale, causing hedge funds (companies who make their money 'betting' on the stock market like in the scenario above) to lose billions of dollars.</text>

    <text>How can the normal people involved in this become rich? Once one person sells the stocks for a high price they get a lot of money, but wouldnt that mean the price will fall? And so the other people wouldnt get that much money?</text>

    <text>Just a general question

Are hedge funds allowed to cover their old shorts with new shorts? 

e.g I borrow 100 stocks from A which goes bad. Can I open a new short position of 100 stocks from B at a higher price and return them to A?

This must be illegal somehow...</text>

    <text>Executives at GameStop couldn't possibly have just been twiddling their thumbs and watching this play out without doing anything, right? If a company can split shares or increase available supply, wouldn't a drastic increase be the best time to do this, and avoid a trading freeze? I feel like I've heard nothing about what the company itself is doing about the situation. They must have been well aware of the 120% short (in which case they would not want to provide more shares), but could they at least have settled the dramatic rally by offering more shares to cover options contracts and avoid the present situation?</text>

    <text>Can the hedgefunds that shorted the stock repay their debt behind closed doors? i.e. they short person A who is their friend 10 stock, they buy 3 stock back, give to person A who then sells right back and gets handed the 3 stock again then sells them right back again to keep the profits going to just friends and make it so others cant buy up the stock making it go higher. Or do they Have to sell on the open market? Or do they Have to return the stocks all at once?</text>

    <text>From my understanding a Short is 

You Borrow someone's stock sell it and then buy when it is cheaper and give it back to them. 

What I don't get is why the original owner of the share would do this. I get that they make interest on the share but they still end up with a net lose right? Say it is 5% interest. If stock drops more then 5% then they lose money.</text>

    <text>Who decides the price of the stocks now? If they're in a point where they cost 400$ and there's only for example 1000 stocks mostly owned by casual people of Reddit, the hedge funds who has to return their borrowed stocks have a limited time (and normally in those contracts how much time is?).


What if all the companies who borrowed stocks have only 1 month to return them? What happened if they don't do it on time

What if the redditors decide the stocks will not be sell for less than $5000 but nobody is buying or selling but the companies have to return in a month their borrowed stocks, can the price mantain without selling or buying those stocks just waiting to the companies to run out of time to returned their debt?</text>

    <text>Have you ever played craps?

The dice game.

There's a come bar and don't come bar. You can bet with or against the roller. There's plenty of other bets(options), but I'll focus on just these two.

You want a "7 come 11", initially. Snake eyes and 12 busts, and do not come wins.

3,4,5,6,8,9,10 result in the 'come' you need to reroll this 'come', and then you win the come. Basic 2 to 1 odds, you either lost or doubled your money.

Rolling a 7 busts you after the come, which is statistically very likely. 1,6; 2,5; 3,4....

It's literally gambling, on the scale of trillions of dollars. It's responsible for economic crashes, and never booms.

It's like casinos always win, just replace casino with hedge funds or billionaires.

They designed this shit. They control it. If you're bold enough to hold GME or AMC, gl hf. That 7 to bust you is more likely than anything else happening, unless you're shorting (do not come), which is, more or less, equally likely. Either could happen. It's unpredictable.

And that's where manipulation comes in. The press seems to be blaming reddit for what's primarily been orchestrated by competing hedge funds, which have profited billions.</text>

    <text>50% of users on Robinhood own some part of $GME. In early 2020 they had 13 million users, and probably closer to 20 million now. Granted they allow partial ownership of shares, so despite the stock being at $400, someone could only own .1 of a share with $40.

There are other popular retail stock apps/sites but I don't think nearly as big as RH.</text>

    <text>One thing to add to the other explanations: 

Options are extremely volatile.  If you buy aggressive options on the right day, the option may be up 200-500% the next morning.   You can also lose 80-90% overnight.  This is why options should be bought very carefully.  Instead, some of the autists on wallstreetbets put all their money on in options on one stock.  

 To make it even more unstable, institutions and individuals sometimes invest on margin, or borrowed money.   This is how these large $13B losses occurred.   

Normally in a short squeeze (as others have described), once the shorts start to lose serious money, they bail out and sell at a loss.    This time, the shorts held their positions and doubled down, risking even more money, betting they could break the back of the Redditors and eliminate their losses.  

     
Rather than just take windfall profits, which is what any sane person would do, wallstreetbets poured even more money into GME calls trying to drive the price into the stratosphere. That is what caused the rise from less than $5 up to a max of $360 yesterday.   GME opened up at $400 today and lost 50% by the afternoon, but made up most of those losses by close.   So it looks like the Redditors are holding the line at this point.  

It is astonishing to see [these guys](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/top/)^(\*) successfully facing down hedge funds.

    <text>Wall street guy wants to borrow your beanie baby that's worth $100. He'll give it back, and pay you $10 to borrow it.

He pawns it for the $100. Pays you $10, and hopes the price drops to nothing... Buys it back for maybe $10, Pocketing the difference..

Normally the most you can lose, is how much paid. But now that beanie baby is worth millions and he has to give it back... Now what?

This is normally illegal except if you are wall street.

Also another was street guy borrowed from the pawn shop to sell on eBay... Now 2 separate people owe the same beanie baby back worth millions..

(It's actually worthless, but no one will sell them theirs.. So they tried to ban anyone else from buying, and only selling on eBay or pawn shops)</text>

    <text>I made this comment a while back but I'm just going to copypaste it here:

GameStop,  or GME, was trading pretty  low the start of the month, around 20 dollars per share . This was mainly  due to  financial reasons, if you know anything about video games at all,  you  would know that digital is the future and GME was relying heavily  on  physical sales up to this point. Think Blockbuster vs Netflix, not  many  people saw a future for GME and expected it to fall further.

Many   large, institutional investors on wall street wanted to use this to   their advantage, and decided to short sell the stock. Essentially, they   "borrowed" a stock, sold the stock that they did not own, and hope to   rebuy the stock at a lower price to repay the stock they borrowed.

Say   for example I loan you a Toyota Corolla for a month. You anticipate  the  value of my car will go down significantly, so you sell my car for  10K  dollars. At the end of the month, if you were right, and Toyota  Corollas  were selling for 6K dollars, you just made a profit of 4K, and  can  replace my car at a profit.

This,   however, is incredibly risky as you can have theoretically infinite   losses. Say for example, Toyota Corollas suddenly spike in value to 20K   dollars. You still need to rebuy my car, so you lose 10K. If, the price   suddenly spikes to 100K dollars, now you're down 90K. And so on.   Compared to buying a Toyota Corolla for yourself, which is far less   risky as you can only lose as much as your initial investment.

Now   I will explain Short Squeeze. If you shorted my car, but halfway   through the month you realized that the price was going up to 11K, you   would want to buy a new car at that point to limit your losses to only   1K. However, since you just bought a new car, due to the laws of supply   and demand, the value of the car will go up further (seeing that more   people now want to buy the car). On a large scale, since so many of   these short sellers are buying new cars, the value of Toyota Corollas   can go up significantly. Apply that logic to GameStop, and you can see   how the value of the stock has gone up significantly.

As   a result, all these large, institutional companies that were shorting   GameStop were playing it incredibly risky, as if the price went up by a   lot, then there's no limit on how much they could theoretically lose   (and some people are estimating they lost billions). And due to some   restructuring of their board of directors, a decent holiday season for   the company, and hype on WallStreetBets and amongst other investors (now   also partially caused by Elon Musk tweeting about the stock), the  stock  price went up. Add that to the Short Squeeze I mentioned above,  and you  can see why the stock price went up so high.

This   means that for the institutional investor who decided to short the   stock, they lose a ton of money, because shorting a stock (riskily) bets   on it going down, but instead it went up like hell.</text>

    <text>Jordan Belfort said this was basically a [modified pump and dump](https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2021/01/27/jordan-belfort-gamestop-stock-surge.cnnbusiness). Why or why not is that an accurate description of what's going on? 

People aren't buying GME because they believe so much in GameStop (at least I'm pretty sure of that), it's purely a money making scheme, and they have to sell all these shares at some point to make their money, otherwise it would be a pointless exercise (or is the actual goal to bankrupt the hedge funds?).  So they get everyone excited, stock shoots up, the smartest people sell at the top, everyone else gets screwed. Isn't that what's going to happen here?

EDIT: I've gotten a bunch of good explanations and conversations on this, basically, the action looks similar to a pump and dump because the price is being forced up, but it's really about screwing the hedge funds that were shorting stocks and overselling. So it's not an effort to hike the price and get out quickly, but to hike the price and force the hedge funds' hands. It's not about making money off of it. 

Of course, plenty of people will make some money, and lots have been talking about everyone getting rich off of this, though I don't really see that happening for *everyone*.

BONUS EDIT: I want to clarify that those are the purported reasons for why this is not a pump and dump. It's hard to say the real motivations of the people that started this whole thing without actually being in their heads. Everyone should have some critical analysis of complex situations like these.

SUPER EXTRA BONUS EDIT: [Check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZTr1-Gp74U&amp;ab_channel=RoaringKitt) from way back in July by the man that (apparently) started it all (AKA u/deepfuckingvalue). This guy has been in on GME for a long time because he seems to have actually believed in GameStop. I'm still not completely clear where the shorting/hedge funds come into play (I haven't fully watched the video because it is quite long) but it seems like its a real mix of different things coming together at the right time for this crazy shit that's happening right now.</text>

    <text>Not really about stocks, but i figured i'd give it a try anyways. Why can banks grant such huge loans with such a small interest. Wouldn't they gain more by placing them in something like the sp500? I understand that they are sold off as bonds to others, but again wouldn't they also be better of with the sp. When the rent is below 2% they actually lose money because of inflation, right?</text>

    <text>I don't understand how shorting a stock works. If A borrows n shares from B, sells them, buys n shares at a lower price and gives them to B, isn't B getting the short (heh) end of the stick here? Why would B give his shares away? And is B somehow hoping the stock price would go up again so his n shares would be worth as much as they were when he had initially lent them to A?</text>

    <text>Basically a bunch of hedge funds took short positions on Gamestop. Actually way too many to the point where there were more short positions than available stock. At one point it dropped to like $2 i think. But some people believed gamestop would do well and invested.  The hedge funds refused to take a loss even as they saw it hit the 30-40 range. Thats when a bunch of people started to buy GME from WSB and have driven the price to 500ish at some points. At this rate those companies could literally go under.</text>

    <text>I have a question. 

I see references that the hedge funds sooner or later will be forced to buy back the stocks they shorted and then the stock will skyrocket and they have to buy it at an arbitrary large value the sellers decide.

Why is that? Who is forcing them and why do they have to buy right there and then to an arbitrary value?

What happens if they can't?

    <text>How do we know that these hedge funds are actually losing lots of money? Eventually the stock price will return to “normal”, can’t they just wait this out? Is there a hard deadline for them to return shares? Could they renegotiate their position and such that they returned shares later? 

It seems from what I’ve read that the increased stock price is in theory very damaging to these short positions, but how will we know that they really are causing billions in losses?</text>

Edit: whoa so many answers, thank you! Going through all now. 

I pretty much know about stocks and shorting from The Big Short so I’m not on the side of hedge funds trying to defend Robinhood’s decision. It’s just how I understood it and want clarity. Why are people downvoting someone trying to learn?! Jeez.</text>

    <text>A small bunch of redditors on r/wallstreetbets saw that some big hedge funds had taken a position of shorting stocks in gamestop. This small group had decided (for either rational or sentimental reasons - we don't know yet) that the company was worth more than the hedge funds thought it was, so bought stock in gamestop themselves.

Usually the hedge funds would make money because the share price would still go down, but the redditor's behaviour reversed this, and the stock went up. Probably to more than the stocks were really worth.

This meant that the hedge funds were going to lose money. The hedge funds still thought that the share price would fall fairly soon, so to cover their losses they shorted again. This time they would make more money because the share price was even more inflated than at the start of all this.

Other redditors saw this and decided to "stick it to the man" and buy up the available shares, driving the price even higher. Their inability to sell their shorted stock at the price they were expecting is called a "short squeeze". The hedge funds continued to stand to lose even more money - so much that they needed billions of loans from other companies. 

Other redditors joined in for the lols or to make money on a rising share price.

At no point has anything materially changed for gamestop the company - they still have a lot of physical stores that are costing them money and the same customer base.

Now nearly the whole of the reddit stock trading community was involved. They were buying gamestop stock for whatever reason and massively distorting the price. 

The stock exchanges have a responsibility to step in when things get really fucked up. They did this and a lot of redditors got angry. Also the platform stepped in and stopped redditors from buying more.

When the dust settles a small fraction of redditors will have made money. A hedge fund or two might have gone broke, but will be bailed out by other actors. A lot of other redditors that joined late will have lost money. If they didn't gamble more than they could afford to lose, then they'll be ok. A lot of them won't be. Some will be ruined.</text>

    <text>It's because the stocks are very volatile. The stocks being volatile can reflect poorly on the company letting people buy these stocks, and could fuck over robinhood/cashapp etc. So they're just trying to cover their own asses and not get in trouble for letting people buy stocks that could be considered by the gov as market manipulation</text>

    <text>They're the current front runners for dominating the electric car market which is rapidly growing.  They have a decent chance of becoming the next google or apple of their respective market.  

Everybody has seen what happens and wants to get in on these companies early on because the potential profit is ridiculous.  Even companies that ultimately suck can make the investors a ton of money just by riding the hype train.  

In the end it's all just gambling.  More importantly it's gambling against other gamblers.  Being able to bluff, see through bluffs, and read the room are more important than fundamentals.</text>

    <text>They can participate in other asset classes. These include real estate, commodities, crypto, other countries' currencies, private equity (businesses that are not on the stock market).

On the flipside, the market does always go up! Google Ray Dalio how the economic machine works. It does a good overview of it.

Yep they can go in bonds. You might get the returns of stocks in any of the above asset classes, but equities (stocks) have shown a fairly reliable return over the past 50+ years or so.

It's also fine if people ebb and flow by where they're keeping their money, that's kind of how the economy works, really. It's what helps drive things forward.

It all comes down to the level of risk that someone wants to carry at the snapshop in their lives.</text>

    <text>I can help. Ok, first off you need to know that you can sell stock you don't own. You and I can borrow from our brokerage (who has the stock in someone elses account) and sell it. We would get the money from the sale in our account and we would owe the brokerage (and really the other person who had it) the shares.


People do this because they expect the stock price to go down. They might sell shares at $10/share and hope to buy them back and return them at $5 per share. They would pocket the other $5 (minus costs). The brokerages make a lot of money loaning shares and charging interest.


A broker won't let you borrow shares unless you have collateral. Just like a regular loan. So they might want you to have $2 in your account for every $1 worth of shares you borrow (2x collateral). Well if the shares you sold go up instead of down, the broker will realize you might not be able to pay anymore. They will force you to buy back the shares at a higher price for a loss.


What happened recently is a hedge fund or funds shorted A LOT of shares. They sold shares they didn't have hoping it would go down. People started buying and it went up. This can cause them to have to buy back at huge losses. Buying shares makes the stock price go higher so the more they buy the more they lose. Right now the losses are estimated to be 70 billion but its going to be a lot more before this is over.


Basically a short squeeze is people being forced to pay back their loans (borrowed shares) because the stock price is too high. This makes it go higher. People think it will happen tomorrow because its been happening all week because hedge funds screwed up.</text>

    <text>It's interesting because they might be avoiding going under because of this. This could come from increased brand awareness or a decision for the board to put out another share offering to take advantage of the new high price.

But, on the flipside, them having been in a position that was avoiding them going under (by hiring a new CEO, making plans to pivot in this new modern era) is part of the reason this is happening, because they weren't going to go down as far as the short sellers wanted them to.</text>

    <text>Yes! You can bid whatever you want, but if noone has an ask that matches, your trade doesn't get executed. The price isn't calculated from that, it's the average of trades that actually get executed.</text>

    <text>In that scenario no trades get executed until someone either puts out an ask at 100 or lower.

You can execute an order with a bid of $1, but if noone offers at the same amount, your trade never gets executed. 

Your bid can also specify a range, so if there's an ask out there that's low, you get the low, but if there's one thats higher but still in your range, your trade still happens. 

You have to remember there are hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands of bids and asks over a stock at any given time, and most are "in the ballpark" so trades happen. That's the volume.</text>

    <text>Usually yes, but only as much of a say as they have ownership. If you own 1/10,000th of a company, then there are 9,999 other votes. If the founder still owns 51% of the shares, then they have 5001 of those votes and can outvote everyone who owns stock. Even if the owner doesn't own 51%, odds are good that your vote won't matter.</text>

    <text>Just generally:

When putting in an order, you have quite a bit of flexibility in what you order. There are a whole host of different types of orders available to you.

First consider that there is something called an order book. This is a list of all open orders for bids to buy and offers to sell, let's say looking like the following. Sometimes you'll see more information, but this is the minimum:

Offers to sell:

* 5 shares for sale at $1000.00
* 98k shares for sale at $193.64
* 19k shares for sale at $193.63
* 142k shares for sale at $193.62
* 180k shares for sale at $193.61

Bids to buy:

* 100k shares for purchase at $193.59
* 106k shares for purchase at $193.58
* 60k shares for purchase at $193.57
* 207k shares for purchase at $193.56
* 10k shares for purchase at $23.09

Spot price is $193.60. That's just the last price a share traded at.

If no new orders come in, then there will not be any trades above. If you have a bid at $193.59, no-one will force you to buy at the best offer of $193.61. 

Now you want to buy $50k of this share. You have a few options available to you. Let's say you absolutely want those shares and don't care much about their price. You can put in a market order that will match at the best possible price. 

The trading engine will find what's the best price available to you. That's $193.61. A trade executes, you get your shares, the spot price changes to $193.61 and the order book is updated:

Offers to sell:

* 5 shares for sale at $1000.00
* 98k shares for sale at $193.64
* 19k shares for sale at $193.63
* 142k shares for sale at $193.62
* 130k shares for sale at $193.61

Bids to buy:

* 100k shares for purchase at $193.59
* 106k shares for purchase at $193.58
* 60k shares for purchase at $193.57
* 207k shares for purchase at $193.56
* 10k shares for purchase at $23.09

Spot price is now $193.61, and no other orders come in. The remaining 130k shares for sale at that price aren't automatically sold, because there isn't anyone buying them.

You do your homework and figure that the share price is undervalued, and figure that it's true value is $201.10. You can put in a limit order which basically says that you are selling your shares at a minimum price. Trade engine can't match this order for you, so puts it into the order book:

Offers to sell:

* 5 shares for sale at $1000.00
* $50k shares for sale at $201.10
* 98k shares for sale at $193.64
* 19k shares for sale at $193.63
* 142k shares for sale at $193.62
* 130k shares for sale at $193.61

Bids to buy:

* 100k shares for purchase at $193.59
* 106k shares for purchase at $193.58
* 60k shares for purchase at $193.57
* 207k shares for purchase at $193.56
* 10k shares for purchase at $23.09

Spot price hasn't changed, no more trades have happened.

A limit order will match on the best price for you. If you're buying, it'll match fist on the lowest offers to sell. A WSB autist decides to put in an order to buy a share at $500. The order will almost always be a limit order, and will find the cheapest offers to match. From the above order book, this is actually $193.61. Spot prices stays at $193.61, but everyone gets notified about that trade. The trade doesn't happen at $500, because it's a limit order.

You get other order types. A stop order is triggered when the price reaches a certain target. This might sound like a limit order, but it happens in reverse. Basically "sell if the price drops below what I set to stop any further losses". There's others that I don't know.

See those weird very high and low orders? Totally doable, although they are extremely unlikely to be matched. When you put in your limit order, you specify how long it will last for, assuming it doesn't get matched. Good Till Cancel means the order will remain until you withdraw the order. Some brokers do a time limit on these of a few months. Fill Or Kill means that the order is immediately cancelled if it can't be matched. Good Till Close will keep the order open until the end of the day. And more. 

There's a whole load more to this, but that's it in a bit of a larger nutshell.</text>

    <text>Let's say the stock is $20, and I want to short 1 million shares. I will need to show I have $20 million in cash in my account and will then be able to open that position. Now 2 days later that same stock is $100 and my brokerage wants to see $100 million instead. If I don't have that money, my brokerage will turn my other assets in my account to cash to cover and close the position. This is why wsb is trying to get to happen to Melvin and Citron. It's possible to push the share value so high that pretty much every short doesn't have the capital to pay for their short position and their brokerage liquidates them.</text>

    <text>A put is a type of option. Options are contracts that give you the right but not the obligation (the option) to buy or sell stock at a certain price by a certain date.


So imagine you buy stock in gamestop at $10 per share. You could tell someone "I will let you buy my shares for $12 at any time between now and next year if you give me $1.50 right now". They agree. You get the extra $1.50 and if the shares go above $12 the other guy might buy them from you for the lower price. If not, they will just buy the shares on the open market for less.


Originally options were used for commodities (oil, wood, corn etc). Places like airlines would want to be sure they could get fuel at a good price so they would enter into contracts to guarantee the price for them (or less if the price dropped).  Paying a few bucks now to ensure you dont have to pay a lot later is good business. On the stock market they are usually used as hedges or leverage (protection from big price drops or a way to increase your risk but increase your payout).</text>

    <text>Theoretically when it comes to buying back the sold stock, the hedge funds can hold it on as long as possible by paying fees. But the hedge funds don't just sell stocks. They sell something called options too. The options have specific deadlines.

 Say if I sell you an option contract telling that within 2 months from today I will sell you 100 shares at 10$ each.You will pay me a fee for this contract. You and I enter a contract saying that  2 months from today I will sell you the stock at 10$ and you will buy it from me for no more than 10$(irrespective of what the stock price will be 2 months from now). If the stock is at 100$ per share in 2 months, you get to buy it at 10$ each still from me because of our contract. I have to somehow buy those shares at 100$ and give it to you. I cannot delay this and I have to do it when our contract expires.

With GME, the hedge funds sold a lot of contracts like this assuming later they can buy the stocks for cheaper price than what they have contract to make profit. But the price of the stock shot up so high that they cannot ride it out for too long as thousands of contract are coming to expiry every Friday. The price shot up so high because the hedge funds badly need a lot of stocks to settle their contracts and majority are not selling ( demand gets too high and price rises)</text>

    <text>You’re basically right - when they borrow the shares, they have to put up collateral. As the price of GameSpot goes up, the short sellers have to put up more and more collateral. Eventually the people who lent out the shares are going to get uncomfortable and demand their shares back.

Depending on how they actually made their bet, there may be some contract timing involved as well.</text>

    <text>The best way to understand it is that this is entirely disconnected from actual game stop at this point. There’s something to be said for some people thinking it’s a dying business, selling physical copies of games in stores when downloading is becoming so prevalent, and something to be said for some people thinking with the new board and CEO, they could pivot into being a profitable business again. This push and pull is where all of this started in the first place, and where it’ll end up when this is all over.</text>

    <text>The last time WSB broke out of it's own subreddit and caused a mega thread, it was very much the opposite.  A WSB member thought he had found an exploit (and well there was also effectively a problem with the RH app that let it happen) through which he could make guaranteed money through a complex derivative trade.  He was very much mistaken...  The guy turned something like a 5k usd investment into a couple 100k Usd in debt.</text>

    <text>The Hedge Funds and other investors felt that GameStop was likely to go out of business. They looked at their business model, and saw that since more and more people are buying videogames online directly as downloads, stores that sell physical games aren't as important anymore. They figured that since GameStop was doing poorly, it would be a good target for this sort of money making scheme, because it's all about getting people to believe that a company is doing poorly so the price of their stock drops.   


The folks at WallStreetBets aren't necessarily fans of Gamestop, but some pointed out that GameStop isn't doing AS bad as some financial experts said, pointing out that they got a new CEO with a lot of experience, and that they didn't do too badly this holiday season.   


Before all this, the folks at WallStreetBets did similar things, just on much smaller scales, going "Hey, I think this stock is a good one! Let's buy it!", not in ways that really affected the stock market as a whole.</text>

    <text>The stock market is a term that just refers to a few different trading markets, the most popular in the US being the new york stock exchange and Nasdaq. A company gives out partial ownership of their company (a share) for a certain price so that they can get more money immediately to build up their company. When someone buys a share of a company, they technically become part owner of the company and are betting on that company to succeed and turn a big profit. There are lots of good books on it, "All About Investing" by esmé faerber is a good one, and can be found very cheap used online. Or you can just read a bunch of articles online to get a better understanding of it</text>

    <text>The top of each line is the highest value the stock got to in the particular period you're looking (typically daily). The horizontal line on the right denotes the close price which is the price the stock was at when trading closed for the day. The horizontal line on the left denotes the open price which is the price the stock started at when trading opened for the day. This will not necessarily match up with the close from the previous day as exchanges typically allow investors to essentially pre-order the stock before open which will affect the price. The bottom of the vertical line is the lowest price the stock reached in that period. The lines are usually coloured red if the stock closed lower than it opened (right line is lower than left line) and black if the inverse is true.</text>

    <text>Because stonks don’t only go up. The economy goes up because the big companies (such as the fortune 500) make insane amounts of money. If you invested in nokia or blackberry 15 years ago, 2 of the biggest brands at the time, they are still not worth what they were at their peak. And that doesn’t even account for 15 years of inflation. 

(Due to the clusterfuck nokia and bb are currently quickly rising but these prices won’t last very long and are not a good indication.)</text>

    <text>A short is kind of like a put option in my understanding. On a put option you buy a contract to buy shares at a certain price with the expectation that price will go down. Your maximum out of pocket loss is the cost of contact per share and your max gain is strike price versus market value. You need to make this trade within a time frame.

With a short sale your buying a security, you're borrowing the stock at the time and selling it at market value with the intention of buying it at a cheaper price to sell back to stock owner. The gain is the same as a put, but the potential loss is having to buy it back at a higher market value. In other words you took out a loan of stock, you hope the stock drops to buy the loan back at less value. You also lose the limitation of strike price, but your maximum out of pocket loss is the market cap for the stocks you bought.

Essentially you're not buying losing stocks to sell, you're betting the distance of the fall in both cases. You do both on companies that are mismanaged and known to be in a bad financial state.

    <text>First thing you have to do is find a good UK broker. You should be looking for a broker that has low commissions on trade, a low minimum account balance, and as little extra fees as possible.

Fro. That point, all you have to do is buy shares of GME and youre helping the cause. As a new trader, it might take some time to understand how to use the platform and what exactly is going on when you make a trade, so I would suggest doing some of your own research before you commit yourself to this.</text>

    <text>That's just not true. 220% of float stock ia shorted, but only 89% of outstanding stock currently.

This is because float stock only takes into account stock which is moving hands (oversimplification, but that's the jist).

It's not "more stock than is in existence", it's just more stock than people are trading (as opposed to sitting on long term).

For example, bezos has no intention of selling his share in Amazon. So most (if not all) would be discounted from float, but included in outstanding.

The stock exists, just they arent relevant.</text>

    <text>The hedge funds borrowed stocks and then sold them. They are contractually obligated to give back exactly those stocks. In this case, they borrowed Gamestop stocks. They can't give back an equivalent amount of BestBuy stocks: they borrowed Gamestop stock, they must return that same number of shares of Gamestop stock; not the same *value* of shares, either - the same *number* of shares, regardless of how much they're worth.

Since the Redditors have the stock, the hedge funds will have to buy it from them so that they can give it back to the people the hedge funds borrowed it from. They don't have a choice: they *must* buy back the stock, regardless of the price. The Redditors can charge *way* more than they paid and make a healthy profit.

That assumes the the hedge funds haven't already bought enough to cover what they owe, or that the hedge funds don't have to buy it back *now* and can wait until the Redditors can't afford to keep holding it for whatever reason and the price goes back down.</text>

    <text>Hedge fund:

Have you ever play the lotto with a group of coworkers, friends or family? You basically form a pool, and buy a bunch of numbers to increase your chances of winning. If you guys win the lotto, you split the winnings. Hedge funds follow that principle, a bunch of people put there money in a pool, the hedge fund invests the money, splitting the earnings (minus commissions).</text>

    <text>Some companies need more money so they can grow. They invite people to give them that money, in exchange for a piece of paper. That paper says "I am one of the owners of this company!" and it is called a "Share." The people who own those papers are called "Shareholders."  If you are a shareholder for a company, sometimes you get to help vote on what that company will do. Sometimes, if the company is making a lot of money, they will give some of that money to the Shareholders. 

If a person likes the company they paid money to become an owner of, they will keep that paper. But if they think that another company is better, they may trade their paper for someone else's, and become an shareholder of a different company. A "stock market" is a way for the people who own these pieces of paper to trade them with other people who have them.

Some people make a lot of money this way. If you are a shareholder for a company that is making lots of money, other people will be willing to give you money for your piece of paper. But if you are a shareholder for a company that is not making a lot of money, no one will want to buy your piece of paper. You will lose money.</text>

    <text>Well A. shorts bet on a company's failure and when people see large hedge funds betting on a company to fail it causes everybody else to do the same, which actually causes the company's failure. B. There were literally more shorts than there were stocks, 140% shorts. It's pretty impossible to lend out more socks than exist for a company and should be criminal. 

Since there are more shorts than stocks, and investors identified this, it's a smart investment to buy the stocks therefore forcing the hedge funds that short the stocks to buy at a new rate. See the thing about shorting stocks as you have a guaranteed buyer in the future because they eventually have to buy those stocks that they shorted back, at whatever the rate is. They're hoping it'll be less, but sometimes it is not. As in this case.</text>

    <text>The fact that shorting exists is the issue.

The fact that hedge funds have been manipulating the markets for decades unchecked and now it's apparently wrong when the poor start doing it?

The fact that it's one rule for the wealthy and another for the poor.

The fact that when the elite absolutely decimated the world economy with their illegal gambling, not a single one of them went to jaila and the public footed the bill, they faced literally no consequences. 

These people are parasitic dragons and have been overdue being brought down for decades.

Edit to add: The hedge funds have sold more shares than actually exist, meaning a significant portion of them were 'naked shorts', which is illegal but, because it's the hedge funds doing it, ignored and unchecked by regulatory authorities.</text>

    <text>There’s two types of investment: one: long term, you just wait as many years as it takes before it’s worthwhile to sell the stock. As long as the company doesn’t go bankrupt, you’ll get an opportunity within two decades or so.

Short term: be an autist and participate in a zero-sum game, hoping you will win. You can do slightly better by always holding out through dips, but you need to pay a lotta hecking attention to something that is really stress inducing, *yet not be stressed into selling*.

All the other complications is just mob mechanics of people guessing how other people will react.</text>

For reference 10% is considered too high and you shouldn't touch it anymore due to high risk; 20% is extreme and you might get fucked the arse and lose your entire business and should go to jail for manipulation imho.

    <text>What happens if the ones that borrowed the stock dies? Like last time the stock market went bananas a lot of people committed suicide, does this screw over the owner of the stock? 

Is he stuck without his stock because someone stole it(borrowed it without permission), sold it, but couldn't give enough "worth" back? Here borrowing it without permission is what I've come to understand what a hedge fond does so correct me if I'm wrong please.

To further go on this comment. Does this mean that when you actually should be fillthy rich of your stocks, you can actually not make a dime since the people loaning it never restored your stock in the first place and now you don't have your stock nor the money you would've had if you wanted to sell your own stock (since someone borrowed it and didn't give it back)?</text>

    <text>It’s not necessarily that you don’t have $3,000. The stock was so heavily shorted that everyone looking to close our their short (by buying back the stock and delivering it to the lender) is driving the price up further- hence a short squeeze. As far as I know there is no expiry on your short necessarily but the margin required could prove to be too much to handle. Also the interest paid on the borrow. You might be inclined to close out your short if you only see yourself losing more in the near term.</text>

    <text>In GameStop's case, everyone thought they were going bankrupt and the stock dropped to about $4.  Short sellers SHOULD have started covering then, but they got greedy and waited for GameStop to go bankrupt so they don't have to repay anything at all.

GameStop didn't go bankrupt.  They got a new board of directors to help them transition into the digital age of gaming, got an angel investors to keep them afloat and signed a deal with Microsoft to share revenue with Microsoft's digital sales for every XBox sold at GameStop.  GameStop sold a lot of XBoxes.

Suddenly, GameStop doesn't look like such a terrible investment anymore and the shares start rising in price.  The shorts are then left between a rock and a hard place.</text>

    <text>Because the price has nothing to do with earnings or the business itself - it is due to a glitch in market mechanics where the stock being shorted 140% is essentially creating infinite demand for the same supply. As long as stockholders hold onto the stock (do not offer it for sale) then the price keeps going up. The shorters are paying interest in the meantime, which is unsustainable - they'll eventually have to buy. As far as I know, the situation is pretty much unprecedented. The closest thing is the VW short on 2008, where Volkswagen briefly became the biggest company in the world by market cap. 

This is why right now the shorters are pulling out all the dirty tricks to try to crash the price.</text>

    <text>Both. Robin Hood is affiliated with Citron which in turn is owned by Melvin Capital.


Or vise verse but they’re all connected; that is why they are being rightfully sued for market manipulation. They gave themselves time to sell their short stock while keeping retail(us) from buying their cheap stock. They hoped we would sell cheap when the price dipped but y’all got them 💎🙌🏻 and held. Meaning they STILL couldn’t by back their stock cheap and lost money.


It’s a beautiful thing.</text>

    <text>Shorting is legal because it helps financial markets function better (economic studies indicate that countries that ban short selling have greater inefficiencies in the markets). Shorts helped expose the shady practices enron did and they also helped expose the banks in 2008.</text>

    <text>The price isn't being dictacted by anything the company actually does anymore. Nobody that's buying shares is selling them, so the price will stagnate or have very little volume until the hedges are forced to start buying at absurd prices</text>

    <text>The problem around all this is that the shorts are at 140%.

This should NEVER have happened, but it did because the rich became fucking greedy.

What these means is, they have sold 40% more share than are avaliable. This is why the stock went up. People saw this greedy act and realised that what this meant.

The hedgefunds and brokers fucked themselves in the ass, and no one (not even the fucking brokers who let it happen because they're greedy fat fucks) want to take accountability.

Therefor, rather than pay what they owe, they're trying to make reddit and retailers look like the bad guys and then are doing blatantly CRIMINAL shit to get prices back down to cover their losses.

In the end, this is all the fault of the hedge funds and brokers.

    <text>Suppose you have an extra Ps5 lying around and just sitting there collecting dust. Let's say I come to you and ask you borrow your Ps5 for a year and I will pay you 100 bucks for that. And let's say I also signed a legal document that says if I cannot give you back the Ps5 after one year, I will have to pay you 5000 USD .. Would you take that deal? Of course you should.. After all you aren't playing that extra Ps5.

And why should you care what I do with that extra Ps5 you got?  As long as I give you back a Ps5 after one year.. it really doesn't matter what I did with yours.. And if I can't find it due to shortage, I'll have to pay you 5000 bucks.. It's a  deal pretty much everyone will take.</text>

    <text>Well the Hedge fund over bought the short position with no regard for potential losses, so at the end of the day who’s the smarter investor. If you make a 10 million dollar bet and have the potential to lose 14 billion are you a smart investor? For every trade there’s a winner and a loser, this go around a hedge fund finally lost money and the exchanges (Robinhood and others) are out to protect a hedge fund that made a poor decision and are actively trying to punish the winners of the trade. Meaning only the little guy can lose and the hedge funds are only allowed to win. Even so Melvin capital still got a 3 billion dollar bailout, would you or I get that absolutely not. So at the end of the day only nobody lost off this trade.</text>

    <text>Billionaire can prevent this by not being so greedy that they short stocks (betting stocks will go down by borrowing shares, selling them the hoping they can buyback for cheaper) to a point where they shorted more shares than actual shares of GameStop existed.

This wouldn’t bankrupt all of Wall Street if they didn’t continuously do this ridiculous tactic to such a degree that they are selling shares that don’t even exist.</text>

    <text>So I hope I can get you to look at this from an alternative perspective with this comment, I hope you understand I'm not attacking you or your stance in any way, I fully agree with some of your points, just not necessarily your method of reaching them.

First understand this is a flash in the pan event, the hedge fund that is suffering is in this position by their own doing. Nobody held their feet to the fire and made these companies short these stocks. Shorting a stock is inherently a gamble, any form of financing essentially is. They borrowed money, they performed their "due diligence" and their risk assessment models were probably usually accurate, but in the clarity that hind sight provides, they clearly fucked up. There's two parts to risk assessment, how likely something is to go wrong, and how seriously it will affect you when it does.

I don't think the average american has any issue with their assessment of how likely this was to happen, their fuckup was just how badly this could go for them if that 1/1,000,000 event happened. This isn't the first time, and until there is effective legislation to prevent these events, or those responsible for causing them are held accountable, these events will continue to occur. The biggest problem is they don't care about how seriously the rare event effects them, because they've never been held accountable for their risk models when they were wrong. They got bailed out in '08, and again in this event, other billionaires are stepping up to protect the hedge funds. That's a level of protection the average consumer doesn't enjoy, and never will, if you default on your house, those same people will take it from you. Remember these guys aren't playing this game with their own money (only a small percentage of it is) often times the source of the money is things like working people's union pension funds and 401ks. Money that people in the boomer generation expected to have for retirement and those accounts haven't recovered to this day. When they fucked up in '08 a lot of those funds went insolvent and disappeared. And after all that, nobody went to jail, the rich stayed rich, and they raised champaign glasses in our direction from their balconies on wall street. These people have the ability to ruin millions of peoples lives, and never once have they been truly held accountable for when it goes wrong under their watch.

Restricting the average persons access to the markets is not the answer. The average person has every right to withdraw every dollar they own, walk out on their front lawn, and light it on fire if they wish. Hedge fund owners do not have the right to treat other people's money in the same way. If the government won't restrict their ability to make risky moves with the money they manage through regulation, the only solution we're left with as a society is to personally hold them accountable through crowd sourced methods. By realizing that this hedge fund was over extended and buying stocks in a way that exposed them, these redditor's have hopefully used natural selection to get rid of a bad hedge fund that shouldn't exist. The government should be protecting consumers from hedge funds doing shit like this, but they're not. Even though all these politicians are "standing by the WSB fellas on twitter!" Most of us have very little expectation that when it comes time to sit down and write effective legislation to prevent this shit, any of them will come through. The economy only functions if the people participating have faith in the system, and we have very little reason to have faith in it because this shit keeps happening.

Some people on WSB probably will lose money on this in the end. The vast majority of those who will know this and don't give a shit. The whole "I'm a retard, don't listen to me" thing is a shtick play on the "I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice" thing. They understand what they're doing. The ones that are going to make a killing on this have owned the stocks for weeks already. The people piling into GME at this point are doing so to show their support for what WSB has done and in the hopes of getting in a decent punch against the hedge funds. They're taking their money into the front yard and burning it, in the hopes a few of the shittiest hedge funds won't survive the event, the vast majority of the ones doing it at this point aren't thinking they're going to make millions. You don't need to feel bad for them, the government doesn't need to protect them, they aren't actually retarded, they're just mostly pissed off. The real people you should feel bad for are the ones who own the 401ks and benefit from the pensions these assholes have been mishandling for years.

I don't speak for anyone on wall street bets or the sub generally, I'm not active in that community and I don't own GME, but I am pissed off at the system and love to see them doing what they're doing. My stance in my post is my personal opinion and just my two cents. Sorry for swearing so much in ELI5. Hopefully you enjoy your day and thanks for riding out this ridiculously long post with me.

    <text>How do you know they'll go down in value? If they stay the same value, I get the $2 and my oranges back. Clearly I would only loan out my oranges if I think they'll be worth the same amount +/- $2. 

Otherwise, I'd charge a higher rent. Which is what all the GME shareholders are about to do to the short sellers tomorrow.</text>

    <text>Nobody is bankrupting wall street. A few hedge funds short sold GME beyond what existing shares can cover (illegally btw). We're just seeing a short squeeze. It's not uncommon and I bet other funds are squeezing as well. It's just more publicized than previous squeezes. It won't be repeated unless some other HFs is involved in naked short selling to such ridiculous extent.</text>

    <text>The thing is retail investors literally did pile onto a trade which was being heavily shorted. Shorted way higher than should be allowed. Retail traders didnt start this, hedge funds who decided to short a company stock into the ground started it and put themselves in a compromising position. Retail literally just capitalised on the mistake.</text>

    <text>The risk isn't usually on the person who loans, since even if the stock goes down tomorrow I can hold for when it goes back up and sell it then, shorting just ensure that while I'm holding the stick for the future I hight make a quick buck since at the end of the day I'll still own all the stock I originally had and and additional $2.

    <text>To many people, one of the major problems with modern western society is wealthy people having too much power - enabling them to make even more money, and thus more power by tipping things in their favour against doing that is best for social as a whole. 

* See the housing crisis' in many developed western countries - a generation cannot afford homes, and many cities are unaffordable to all but the highest earners. Yet consistently governments have failed to address this over decades, instead enacting policies which only protect property values and extrapolate the problem. Why?, because rich people, landlords (including many elected representatives who vote on these policies) would loose value in their investments, and these rich people have the power to influence government policy in their favour over society as a whole.

* See the environmental crisis - the world is literally being made uninhabitable through human activity, with all models showing poor people will be hit hardest and first. We known for decades, yet policies consistently fail to make the changes that are inevitably required. Why?, because doing what needs done will disrupt the financial markets, and restrict businesses who profit from damaging the planet, and those interests have the power to stop the government's making changes that damage them.

* See the 2008 financial crash. Wholely the fault of reckless financial institutions and their complicit governments. Wholely paid for by working people who got fucked. None of those responsible were held accountable and they are at it again on the next scam. Some countries which did hold their banks responsible recovered far quicker, but others couldn't do that because those financial institutions have too much power over government.

Hedge funds are a symbol of that wealth that leverages its power to gain more money. They manipulate financial markets as standard procedure. They profit on businesses failing. They acted illegally in shorting over 100% of the stock of this company. And they got caught out. Caught out at their own game by plebs like us. And when they got caught out breaking the law to make millions for themselves, they broke the law some more to get out of it - they got the investment platforms to stop selling to plebs like us, so only they could buy the stocks they illegally owe others, driving the price down and further fucking the little guy.

They are a blatant example of the system being rigged, of rules being only for thee. To bring progress to the world so that future generations can have the society we want - with social mobility, a healthy environment, improved quality of live, improved health - all of which is going backwards in western societies - we need to end the powers that these establishments hold. This story excites that sentiment as it involves the power of the people using technology to fight these evil powers, and it includes those evil powers using their I'll gotten leverage to stamp on the little guys again.</text>

    <text>The hedge funds that are/were shorting (betting the stock will fall) are pretty much known to be market manipulators. They use "legal" tactics and media influence to drive the price down in order to cash in on the drop in stock price. Sometimes forcing weak companies into bankruptcy just for a quick buck. SEC does not seem to care that they do this. 

There was some brief media talk of wsb being in the wrong for market manipulation despite the blatant rule bending these hedge funds do consistently.</text>

    <text>Like he said, when he borrowed the oranges the person who lent them gave them a deadline to return the oranges AND an additional $2 debt, so no matter what happens with the stock at the end the person who lent the oranges will be $2 richer. In market though usually they don't have a fixed debt rather an interest that accumulates on the borrowee (is that a word idk) the more they hold the stock.</text>

    <text>Hedge funds and their investors are (stereo)typically very wealthy people whom aggressively invest their money in many different ways. They are often depicted as the villain in many Wall Street fables.

Watching some of the better known funds record steep losses at the hands of retail investors (aka “Main Street “) evokes a sensation of underdogs winning. 

Please read a better explanation of different fund types that I copied and pasted below:

You and I as individual investors can trade a company's stock, bonds, commodities etc. on a public market.

Then there are investment companies which offer pooled funds, where we can put in money and they will bundle it together and trade common securities (stocks, bonds etc.) for us, hopefully getting positive returns while saving us from having to do the work ourselves. There are different types of such funds, mutual funds being the most common – either actively managed by an investment manager or tracking some index like the S&amp;P 500. The basic idea is to buy hundreds or thousands or more securities together to not be affected by fluctuations in a single one.

Hedge funds take things up a notch. They are specialized and exclusive versions of mutual funds open only to institutional investors or very high net worth individuals. They are also far less regulated than publicly accessible funds. Hedge fund managers use very aggressive investment techniques and invest in a wider array of products than just stocks or bonds – like options and other derivatives, real estate, currencies, art, precious metals or really anything else that can be bought and sold. They often use large amounts of borrowed money (aka leverage) and so are generally exposed to a lot more risk than normal funds. They also frequently take short positions (bet that a stock will go down instead of up) in order to "hedge" against market downturns or take advantage of failing companies.”</text>

Notice how it tells you that institutions own more shares of GameStop stock than actually exist and that the amount of shares in short positions outnumber the number of shares available to trade by quite a bit. *I think*.

    <text>Speculative and manipulative business.   


short version ( look above for longer ) : you sell at marketprice something you dont actually have: you get 300 $.   
after a certain time period younare forced to buy what you sold. ( so the shorter doesnt buy it at the beginning, he only sells something) 

&amp;#x200B;

if the stock went down the shorter can buy it for less, i.e. 200.

NetGain: 100

&amp;#x200B;

if the stock goes up you lose money because you have to buy stock at marketprice. delending on the rate people are selling this will drive up the price of the stock more.</text>

    <text>So what makes short squeezes an unreliable strategy in playing the stock market? Is it simply hoping there is enough holding to cause an uptick and trying not to be the last one to sell?</text>

    <text>You shouldn’t be concerned about it. 25 years is plenty to recoup any losses considering the cyclic up and down nature of the market. Due to tax implications and compound interest you wouldn’t want to take the money out of your 401k anyway. Like a few others said, you might want to hedge yourself and hold money outside of the market. The only way this would really affect your 401k or pension is if they are directly invested with those funds and/or stocks.</text>

    <text>Not necessarily.

If GameStop, in the year 2000, initially offered 100 shares of their company out of a total of 1,000 shares, and Person A bought 10 shares, then they’d “own” 1% of GameStop. That IPO (initial public offering) purchase money would go to GameStop to use at their discretion (pay debt, expand, acquisitions, etc).

Now, 20 years later, Person A decides to sell their shares to Person B. Person B would now “own” 1% of GameStop, but the money they paid for the stock would go to Person A, not GameStop, since Person A was the entity that owned that particular share.</text>

    <text>Underlying business is independent of share prices. Share prices only matter when a company raises equity capital by issuing new shares. GameStop doesn't need to raise capital and so is completely unaffected by the price movement. Only shareholders are affected.</text>

    <text>Sure!

First, forget about the 2 people, that are holding, no matter what. They aren't important for this example, just wanted to include it, to explain the "float". But let's stick to the 5 apples, that are available at the market.

Alice buys 3, because she thinks they will rise in price.

The other 2 apples are traded back and forth between traders, so they also don't matter for this example, just keep in mind, there are still 5 apples overall.

Bert comes to the market. He heard somewhere nobody likes apples anymore, so he thinks the apples' price will decline. To profit from this, he asks Alice, if he can lend her apples and promises, that he will give them back in the future. In return, he pays Alice interest. Alice agrees.

To make his dream come true, Bert needs to sell the 3 apples (that actually belong to Alice) at the market. He will later buy them again and give them back to Alice, hoping he can buy them for cheaper as he sold them at the beginning. He then will give them back to Alice and can pocket the difference. So he does exactly that, he sells the apples for the market price. That makes it 3 apples "short".

Now Carl comes to the market. He is looking for apples and sees, that Bert is selling 3 apples (remember, those are Alice's apples).

Danny heard the same rumors as Bert and plans to do the same. So he goes to Carl, who has 3 apples. Danny asks Carl the same as Bert asked Alice, and Carl accepts. Carl lends his 3 apples (actually Alice's apples, which neither Danny nor Carl know) and ~~Carl~~ Danny sells them at the market again (remember that plan, that Bert has in mind, it's the exact same thing).

The situation is as follows: Bert shorted 3 apples. Danny shorted 3 apples. That makes it 6 apples short. I hope that explanation makes it clearer. If not, just hit me up again.</text>

    <text>No, the 1% is fixed and it’s a flat rate.  Like interest on a mortgage.  If you borrow $100,000 at 5% from a bank, and the house increases in value to $200,000 then you’re being charged 5% on the initial loan not the market value.</text>

    <text>I have a fidelity account that was approved for margin years ago when i had a lot of money in it. Eventually i wound that account down to $500 to play with. 

Usually i could buy whatever with that $500 and i think one of the screens would ask if i wanted to settle in cash or margin.

Today if i put in AMC or GME it didnt ask for cash or margin. Just went right to an error that I needed at least a $2000 margin balance to trade thoss stocks.</text>

    <text>Hard to say really. While this was news before, the trading halt on brokerage sites might end up the big story. How it really played out isn't fully known despite what you might get told here. I do think it will be investigated though.

    <text>When you lend the stock you get a very tiny small interest back.

The risk for the lender is if the borrower cant give back the stock which normaly never happens because brokers ask client to put cash as margin when shorting, which acts as a collateral if something goes wrong.</text>

    <text>Brokers lend those stocks, individual owners have given them permission to do so through initial terms and conditions they sign up for. These owners are not aware when and if their stocks are being lent by brokers (who make some earning by lending) to short sellers.

So a short seller would 1/borrow a stock, 2/pay some price for borrowing to the broker, 3/ sell it at current price hoping the price will come down in future (before they have to return the stocks), 4/ when the price comes down for stock (before contract to return  is up) , they buy it back (say borrowed/sold at 10 and bought back at 6, so 4 dollars is the profit for short seller) and return to brokerage firm</text>

    <text>Bonus: A short sell work like this:

I borrow your $20 wheelbarrow, which I promise to give back to you next week. I immediately sell it. I think they're going to go down in price, and if I can buy it for $10, I've made $10 profit and can give you back a wheelbarrow.

Of course, if the price of wheelbarrows goes UP, I'm screwed. And theoretically, wheelbarrows might be worth a million dollars next week, so how MUCH I'm screwed isn't limited by how much money I had to start with. That's why selling short is so risky.

Since you asked about Margins, here's how they come into play. Because I'm BORROWING that wheelbarrow, you have to be sure I'm going to give it back. So you make me put down a deposit on the value of the lawnmower. And in theory, to keep me from getting myself into too much trouble, that deposit has to be a percentage of the value of the lawnmower. Let's say it's 150%, so I have to give you $30 up front, which I get back when it's all done.

Here's a trick, though: when the price of the wheelbarrow shoots up, you might call me up and say, "Hey, the price of wheelbarrows is now $200. I need you to deposit more money: you need to have $300 in your account." This is called a Margin Call.

If you don't have the money, I can demand that you bring me a wheelbarrow, which means you don't have a choice but to go buy a $200 wheelbarrow and bring it to me. You might have to go make some MORE risky bets and get yourself in MORE trouble to cover that.</text>

    <text>Well it doesn't directly, that's the problem with "the stock market is good so the economy is good" logic we've been seeing these past four years (and longer)

One thing to remember though is the people making decisions most likely have stock and could panic if it drops. Even more so if they have savings invested. They may cut operational costs (like jobs) to make up for the losts in the stock market either to just earn more money or to show investors they're doing well and that they should put more money in their company

I believe in a large crash where huge amounts of people lose their jobs it comes more from the people who pay the paychecks just not having enough money after they lose some of theirs in the market

    <text>All right... So GME is GameStop. Their profit is the stockholder's profit. Right?

&gt; The only difference is that if you want to sell your portion of the pie in the company, it’s only worth what somebody else is willing to pay for it.

This is the part I have trouble wrapping my head around. If the company is doing well, why would someone not pay what it's worth? Why does the stock price not necessarily correlate? I definitely see that that's true, but I don't understand why.

The stock market has always made me feel dumb...</text>

    <text>Honestly I'm not sure who decides where the strikes come from. But the markets markers tend to sell the majority of the options. Generally they will sell them as naked options then as they get closer to being in the money they will buy the stock under the strike price to cover that position. Gme has had multiple "gamma squeezed" up to this point caused by the way options work like this. 

Basically WSB is full of idiots that buy massive amounts of OTM (Out of the Money) call options. Share price manages to get close enough so the big dogs start buying shares to cover which causes the price to go up and suddenly shit hits the fan and they lose control of it all.

    <text>That would be called naked shorting, but there's no evidence of that. What could happen is someone borrows the stock from the broker and sell it immediately to another broker. Promise to pay back the value of the stock at hopefully a lower price in the future, the short position is now open. 

Another person can short the same share by borrowing it and selling it immediately to another broker to open another short position. They don't know that the same stock was borrowed and sold previously. So 2 short positions open from the same share.</text>

    <text>They've shorted more stocks then is actually available, so they can't close their positions even if they bought every single stock. 

Furthermore, as soon as they start buying to fill their short orders the price will skyrocket, even if they can get some at $40, the price will very quickly shoot up to $400 or more since nobody is actually selling</text>

    <text>I wouldn’t necessarily call it a liquidity crisis - it can create situations like we see in GME. People know that more shares are “owed” than exist in the market, so if people buy and hold, it drives the price up. Eventually people who borrowed a share need to buy one to return, but as people buy and hold, there are fewer and fewer shares available. Supply and demand causes the price to run up really fast.</text>

    <text>It’s not specific shares that have been borrowed, it’s just the number of loans. 

Think of it like this: 

A lends to B, who sells to C
C lends to D, who sells to E
E lends to F, who sells to G

In this case, one share has been loaned out 3 times. B, D, and F each need to find a share to return to A, C, and E. If there’s only one share for them to buy and return, it’s going to get really expensive, especially if everyone knows that there are three borrowers chasing one share.</text>

    <text>They were trying to wait out the rise. They figured that the retail investors would lose interest and start selling. Once the selling starts they could snowball it with more short selling to make even more money.

This doesn't work if people continue to buy, bidding up the price, and then holding.

The real problem for the short sellers will start tomorrow, Friday, when options start to get exorcised.</text>

    <text>When you want to buy/sell you can do it two ways. You can enter a "bid"/"offer" for what price you will buy/sell at. Or you can buy the lowest offer/sell to the highest bidder. Since the bids/offers can be different from the last sale price, this is what moves the price.

The key point is that the current published price isn't what you will necessarily pay if you want to buy now, its just what it last exchanged hands for</text>

    <text>If 100 people want to sell for $1, and 1000 people want to buy for $1, then 100 people will buy and there will still be 900 people looking to buy for $1 but no one willing to sell at that price. There is now a "bid ask spread" of 1 cent.

Let's say there's another 100 people willing to sell for $1.01. If new people declare they want to buy at $1.01, or people from the previous paragraph cancel their $1 buys and agree to $1.01, now the stock price has gone up.

Now let's say this continues upwards for a month, the stock price could become $5 and people from that original buying group might still have their buy orders in the market at $1, with no hope of the sell price reaching that anytime soon (if they haven't set an expiration on their buy orders).

Basically when there's an imbalance in between how many shares are looking to be bought and sold, the price shifts. The "bid ask spread" is a more accurate representation of the current stock price. But for most stocks that aren't "pennystocks" this spread will be very small like 1 cent.

If the bid/ask are the same price, selling and buying occurs until the bid and ask are spread out again.</text>

    <text>Whenever someone buys a share that’s the price that gets displayed, for stocks where there are multiple shares being bought every second you’ll see the price constantly change. 

As for how the price is decided, it’s supply and demand like you said. If more people want to buy than sell then the price gets pushed up and viceversa.</text>

    <text>The price automatically gets increased.
The orders are taken over a virtual market.
And hence we can say it's an algorithm which shifts the price automatically if certain volume of shares start being traded at a higher or lower strike price.</text>

    <text>I think the better question is: how long does your family member have before they would absolutely need to sell because they need that money? If it's tomorrow, then they are not in a good spot. If it's years from now then they'll be fine. Unless the companies she's invested in are going to go insolvent like blockbuster then the trend over the long term is for prices to go up (some more than others, others not much at all). So they should confirm what they are holding with their adviser, and hold onto it unless the loss is driven by a company that is in really dire circumstances. At that point again though speak to their advisor.</text>

If I were her, I would just wait it out and when things are going well then think about putting some of the gains into a savings account over time to keep them safe. But probably better to talk to her financial advisor about all that.</text>

    <text> Yeah Mike is free, hence people buying and holding. They have no obligation to sell but the shorter has an obligation to buy it, thus driving price up if no one buys in. And yeah, that's kind what's going on. If the vast majority don't sell then whoever shorted is on tap to pay fine after fine, adding more collaterall up to the person they owe until they have to buy it back from whoever they can at a massive loss.  
  
As for the second, no clue. I think part of the issue is that no one really seems to regulate Wall Street.</text>

    <text>With a normal short, you have 0 shares, so you borrow 100 shares (or whatever), then sell them, putting you back to 0 shares.  Now you have money from the sale, but you still owe the lender 100 shares.  And they're charging you interest for borrowing shares until you return them.

A naked short,  you have 0 shares, you DON'T borrow 100 shares, you just sell 100 shares you don't even have.  No interest because you never borrowed them.  It's illegal.</text>

    <text>For you and me?  You borrow it from your brokerage.  They charge you interest for the loan.  

For gigantic institutions? No idea, but the gist is the same.  

And your brokerage charges interest for the lent shares, so they make money for the duration of the transaction.  Assuming there's no shenanigans that prevent you from paying them back, it's free money for them.  Of course, there is some risk, which is part of why they're charging interest for the loan.   Just like every other loan.  They're just loaning an asset instead of cash.</text>

    <text>No.  But there's usually stipulations like if the price skyrockets and they doubt your ability to pay it back, they may be able to take and sell your other assets in the portfolio to cover your losses.  Kind of like if you stop paying your mortgage, they can come take your house... Your portfolio is the collateral in this case, instead of your house with a mortgage.</text>

Essentially what I want to know is if this is as commonplace as some friends want me to believe. I'm perfectly capable of googling myself, but being non-native in english and lacking more than a few essential economic terms (even in my native language to be honest) makes me question not only the quality of the sources I find but also what they actually mean.

    <text>Yeah so the dip today was definitely a deliberate move by hedge funds to drive down the price to buy back the shares at a lower price. However I read somewhere that they’re still over 100% of shares for shorting, which means they’re still very much in the game and the short squeeze hasn’t been completed. Tomorrow a lot of the call options are going to expire in the money which is going to drive up the share price even more. Eventually it’ll get to the point where hedge funds will realize it makes more sense for them to cut their losses and buy shares (temporarily increasing the share price) in order to cover their shorts. Either that or shareholders decide to mass sell off which drives the price back down. In theory shareholders could hold on to the stock forever and the share price would keep going up indefinitely. There’s also the fact that banks can demand the shares back at any time if they feel they don’t think the hedge funds will be able to cover future losses</text>

    <text>Do you mean why would people buy or sell when there isn't really good or really bad news? A few reasons. First is that good and bad news is risky. If it was known that good news would always do move the stock up by X, and bad would always move the stock down by Y, then fewer people would play the game. The gamble is part of the allure, in a way. 

Another reason is that a single human can almost never beat the financial industry machine when it comes to acting on information. If you're hearing about a bad thing that happened to a company, and you think it may affect the stock price, then it's practically guaranteed the investment bankers, who are paid to do this all day as their entire career, also heard and decided how likely it was to move. By the time you get there, the stock is already up or down.

In either case people are more likely to succeed at playing a longer game. I buy stock today at $15, not because there's news, but because there is not news and the market agrees its around $15. And I decide I'll hold it for a year, because this company had an industry event coming up where I hope they'll unveil something cool. A year goes by, and maybe the stock is $30 now, because they did get some good press. So I can sell now, still a normal day when everyone agrees the price is around $30, and I still doubled the money I put into this stock over the year. Or maybe I hold it and wait for $45. 

Even if the price had stayed the same over a year, oh well. I sell for $15 when I'm done with this one, and move the money to something else. But since all investors aren't on the same schedule, whenever I'm trying to buy in, someone else has decided to cash out, so that's who I buy from on an average day. 

One last thing I should mention, there's something else some stocks do, which is called dividends. It's company income that they send to their shareholders based on how many shares they own. It's not as common as it used to be, but some people just buy a stock and hold it so they can be paid dividends when a company is profitable. 



Finally, none of this is advice! Most people who make real money do not do it by being an individual who dabbles at picking a stock and buying it and selling it, like I've described here. The profits the market makes is on people who sold and bought too early and too late. It's essentially gambling when you're an individual, which is why hedge funds exist.

Current doctrine suggests if you want money and don't want to gamble, buy an index fund and hold it for 30 years no matter how the price changes in the middle. They call it time in the market rather than timing the market. I'm just trying the explain mechanically how the market functions.</text>

    <text>Well, weekly and monthly options expire tomorrow and every Friday (for weeklies). Without getting into detail about options if the market closes above $300 tomorrow, they will be *forced* to buy a shit ton of shares. But they will still not be able to buy and return every share. 

On top of this, the amount they are buying will skyrocket the price of one share, making it harder to buy back. Think of it like this, if you borrowed and sold 5 phones at $1 each, it’s going to be MUCH harder to buy back those phones when each one costs $500. 

They are losing billions per day. The only two options: 

1. Nobody sells. There is only a finite amount of available shares and they will buy every single one that hasn’t been bought already. This can send the price up to thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions. There is literally no limit to the potential value of a stock. As the supply goes down, demand increases. They will go broke and interest will liquidate them. 

2. People sell and/or they use market manipulation tactics to bring the price down to dirt cheap amounts so they can slowly buy themselves out of this mess at cheaper rates.</text>

    <text>Yes because when short selling was profitable, the loan wasn't due. He didn't have to give back the borrowed stock yet. Now that the stock value is up so high, the hedge funds want to the price to go back down before they buy back the borrowed stock they sold in order to return it to their lender.</text>

    <text>Technically the price of the share can continue to increase to any number, there is no cap on how much a share will cost. As more and more people buy and hold the stock, the higher the price the share is, and thus they can lose infinitely because they HAVE to buy back the stock by a certain date. So they will lose money as long as the stock is more expensive than when they sold it, it's just that it can go to $100 a share, $1,000 a share and even higher. Whether or not it will, time will only tell.</text>

    <text>I cannot say but it will be quite chaotic in wsb subreddit when it does. 
It starts when shorts are forced to close their positions (recall, they borrowed a share at a previous date and sold it for the price at the time hoping to buy it back at a lower cost, pocketing the difference, then returning the borrowed share.) and that subsequently feeds into a rapid climbing of the price due to increased buying.

scroll down https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortsqueeze.asp and watch the short but concise video :)

edit: the unique position with GME stock is that the number of shorts exceed the number of existing shares (how that's possible, i don't know), so everyone who owns shares and chooses to hold only drives up the price that the shorters will have to close at. when it spikes, it can easily double, triple, (possibly even more?!) in price for a short period. The Volkswagen short squeeze is often referenced.</text>

    <text>Imagine this example with fake numbers.

They burrow 10 stocks which cost $10 each (total: $100) because they expect the stocks to lose value. They have to return those stocks in a week. They sells those stocks at $10 each ($100). A week later, they did lose value, and are now valued at $8 each. They buy 10 stocks ($80) and return them, netting a $20 profit.

The lower those stocks could have gone is $0 so the max profit would have been getting them back for free, returning and netting a $100 profit.

But there's no limit at how much they can increase in value. If each of those stocks ended up being $500 by the time they have to return them, they would have to spend $5000 buying 10 of them.</text>

    <text>A short means you’re selling a stock you don’t own (typically borrow and pay interest and a deposit “margin”) with the intention to buy it later at a lower price because you expect the stock to go down.

If you sell at $100 and it goes down and you buy at $50 (to give back to the lender) you made $50.

But in theory the price could go up to $1 million or more and you would have to buy at that price to repay the loan of the stock. You could try to wait it out but you may have a set repayment date (certainly you have to put down more margin which may not be affordable).</text>

    <text>When you buy shares normally, you can only lose the money you spent (if the share value goes to 0). With a short, you need to buy a share to return to the person you borrowed it from, so if the share price keeps increasing, the account of money you have to pay (lose) increases. There's no theoretical limit to this because the share price can increase in value infinitely</text>

    <text>Ok, I need to go to bed so I will try to make this short, and I’m kind of stupid and don’t understand it all myself. This is my stupid example of a “short”. For an institutional investor to short a stock they essentially “borrow” stock from someone else, sell it instantly, then when it drops, they buy it back and return it to whomever they borrowed it from. For example they want to short gme and it’s worth 100$ per share. They borrow 10 shares and sell them immediately to get 1000$. Then they wait for the stock price to drop, let’s say to 50$ per share, then buy the shares back and return them to whomever they borrowed them from. Netting 500$. So what happens if the stock price goes up. They still have to buy it back. So if the price per share increases to 200$ then they would have to pay 2000$ to get the stock back, losing 1000$ on the trade. So what if the stock goes up to 50,000$? They still have to buy them back at some point and it it stays at 50,000$ per share then they have to spend 500,000$ to get the shares back, essentially losing 499,000$. So the sky is the limit. The short sellers are hoping the price drops so they can buy back at a lower price and make money, but what if the price doesn’t drop or just keeps going up? Eventually they will have to buy those shares and lose a fuck ton of money. So the amount of money they lose just depends on how high the stock price goes, and that is determined by supply and demand.</text>

    <text>Thx
But why can’t they just buy all stocks which get sold now? Or better how is decided who gets a stock if multiple people want to buy more then there is on the market?

Furthermore if the Hedgefonds really can’t buy back enough stocks(if everyone on reddit holds for example and they need these from redditors to get enough stocks )  till Friday/their deadline for returning the borrowed ,what happens then?</text>

    <text>Sorry yeah my wording was poor, I just mean that if they do have cash coming in (by selling off some of their stock at these insane prices) then they potentially have the opportunity to make a recovery that not a lot of dying companies get. People have also been optimistic as a guy by the name of Ryan Cohen (who was his own success story from his company Chewy) acquired a 13% stake in GameStop and is apparently helping steer the ship a bit.</text>

    <text>Yes. GME isn't directly involved in the buy and sell of the stocks unless it is issuing new stocks or buying back stock. 

Though you bring up a good point because if I ran GME, I would issue (sell) more stocks (which would be sold at the current hundreds of dollars per share) as quickly as I can. This is the perfect chance for me to raise capital for the company without borrowing it.

GME isn't actually worth $400 a share. Its fundamentals can barely justify $40 a share. Price is up now because of reasons not tied to how profitable or viable the company is. So if GME was smart, it would raise money and basically get 90% of the capital for free. 

But doing so would screw the people who have bought this week because the shorters would suddenly have an influx of stocks to buy and don't have to keep bidding the price up.</text>

    <text>The problem is that as long as there are any sellers, the shorts will be covered eventually. Even if Reddit holds 80pc or whatever, that remaining 20 can churn back and forth until all the positions have been closed.</text>

    <text>When stock is sold it is usually sold from one entity to another, not from the company to an entity. A company may have some stock stored up for them to sell to raise money, and the CEO and other ranking people often have a bunch of stock they can sell personally, but most trades are between other entities. 

When new stock is created, that's called "issuing" stock, and that's one way a company raises a bunch of money, by making new stock and selling that to the market. But again, that's not a "normal" thing, in that it doesn't happen hundreds of times a day every day for each company or anything.</text>

    <text>This is called an uncovered, or naked, short. It is borderline illegal, falling barely on either side of legality depending on the circumstances. You are pretty much selling a stock without first even borrowing it, and if you can’t find the stock by the required date this is called “failed to deliver” which bring penalties such as paying the value of the stock. 

It is far more risky as you aren’t limited by the number of shares available, and is why the hedge funds are so screwed here. If you only borrow 100% of the shares you are limited to paying back the current price of each share multiplied by all available shares, but if you’re you decide to sell shares that don’t even exist you could end up owing infinite funds (in theory). 

For example, if I sell a stock I don’t have for $10 per share and there are 100 total, I make $1,000. I am hoping to sell them for buy them back for $5 in the future and make $500. If I’m so confident that it’s going to drop I can sell 1,000 shares (even though only 100 actually exist) and hopefully make $5,000, but if the stock price rises to say $500, then I now owe $490,000. GameStop has millions of shares, and so these hedge funds are tens of billions of dollars in the hole now. 

This is partially what cause the 2008 crash.</text>

    <text>Usually it is brokers that loan out their client’s stocks. So if I own 500 GME as an investment then my broker might loan 250 of those to a short seller saying you must give us this back in 2 weeks... since most people won’t sell stock when it’s going down it is a pretty good gamble that someone won’t clear their position and will never notice the stock “missing”.</text>

    <text>Yep. Just repay the share(s) is all you have to do. It's the share price that determines whether you win or lose (The number of shares multiples your winnings/losses).</text>

    <text>Now consider the opposite scenario. Turns out it was Microsoft stock and this was 1986. You borrow a share at $30, sell it, and stick the $30 in your purse right next to the IOU receipt. Oops, bad choice. That same share is now worth $50,000. 


The higher the price of the stock rises, the more you get (short) squeezed. In fact, if the stock price keeps rising and rising, the loss could be infinite! Of course, since I'm in the business of loaning out shares to gamblers, I have certain rights to protect me. I mean eventually could owe me more than you could possibly repay! You can get legally forced to buy a share to return to me, even if your lose your home as a result. Sucks for u!

But what if instead of a person, it's a massive hedge fund worth billions. And, they borrowed more shares than actually exist in order to sell short. They pick companies that are obviously going nowhere like strip mall video game trading stores, VHS rental stores, and cell phone manufacturers that peaked in 2002. 

Only problem is that smart individuals like DFV noticed and proposed giving the hedge fund a squeeze back. By using social media, word spread that the billionaire hedge fund left the vault wide open and all within the rules! It works, and they're about to get squeezed. 

What happens? They start cheating. That what we witnessed in real time today. We watched the rigged system cheat.</text>

    <text>They can. You don't have to return *his* share. Just *a* share. And so basically, if your bet works, because everyone is selling, you're gonna get the share really cheap. Of course the guy who you borrowed from is going to sell as well as soon as you deliver.
Now the problem that happened with GME was that people shorted (made the abovementioned bet on) more Gamestop shares than were available. Now, if the price doesn't drop, and no one is willing to sell, you have to raise your offer for the share you need to replace, until someone is willing to sell to you. That's the squeeze. You lose money.</text>

    <text>Eh... I'm no expert but it's not like they're defrauding anyone, if you think a stock will tank you short it, in the process you pay me some premium for borrowing it from me, if the stock tanks? you made some money and the premium you payed softens the blow for me, if it doesn't tank? you just lost some money and I just made some. All parties involved actually benefit from the shorting process so it's not inherently evil, but then again sometimes shit like this happens.</text>

    <text>&gt;And why didn’t the irresponsible short-sellers who will have to buy it all back not jump in to buy back their own shares before the prices went so high?

This is why a lot of us didn't buy into the short squeeze argument in November. We thought they wouldn't be dumb enough to keep shorts positions open for too long. Firstly the short interest was way too high, secondly Ryan Cohen had already got in by August and lastly, console revenues (from Christmas sales) were bound to push Q4 results high. Still not sure why they didn't close.

&gt;How would the redditors who currently own these shares know not to accidentally still hold them too long and end up with a loss?

Fact is a lot of people who bought in late WILL end up with losses, it's inevitable. The indicator that the squeeze is over would be a drop in open short interest, which will be seen in data released by Ortex or S3.

&gt;So, how many redditors have just become millionaires?

Not too many I think. Turning your money 220 times in 16 months like DFV did is an anomaly. I've seen a few screenshots with million+ gain, but they seem to have already been millionaires. For DFV this was an actual life changing moment. He lives in a rented house and this $50k was a lot of money for him.</text>

    <text>No, you're paying interest to the borrower for everyday you do not return the pillow. Soon the interest payments may begin approaching the entirety of your expected profit and you'd have to decide if you want to buy back the pillow at whatever price, or keep paying interest and go into deeper and deeper loss each day.</text>

    <text>Because short sellers "borrow" shares from someone else. They pay a fee to do this. Which is why people loan them shares. But the same number of shares has to be returned to the original owner, usually a pention fund or other find.</text>

    <text>The price of GME has gone up over $100 after-hours today. It closed at $195 and is now at around $310. To be honest you will probably be better off setting a limit buy for like $200 during market hours tomorrow, and if it keeps going up, then buy at market value just before close.

This is speculation, and I am not a financial advisor.</text>

    <text>What John Oliver did was imitate a debt collection company. Hospitals don't want to spend tons of money hunting down people to try to get them to pay bills they likely won't pay. So what they do is sell the right to collect that debt to another company for a smaller amount so they get some money. Then the debt collection company gets to collect that debt from the debtor and keep that money. John Oliver bought some of that debt and forgave it nothing to do with Wall Street.</text>

    <text>When a firm is being squeezed, they don't hold all their assets untouched until they declare bankruptcy. Their position will slowly unwind through margin calls as they lose more and more money. As they unwind, some investors will be paid back what they're owed, while others at the end of the line are left with nothing. That's counterparty risk though, and has to be considered when you enter into a trade with someone.

When this happens to one firm, it's not a disaster for the rest of us, but in 2008 nobody could afford to pay anybody else and we were looking at a Great Depression level scenario without intervention.</text>

    <text>Shorting is a necessary and important part of a proper market.

Shorting adds liquidity to a market and if people could only make money when companies increased in value, then there would be an inbalance of misinformation available. Essentially, markets could be easily manipulated upwards (because investors are incentivized to exaggerate the value/success of a company). There would be no financial incentive for anyone to counter those claims and to share truth. With the ability to make money on the downside of markets, there will be people that can balance out upward-facing misinformation with truth and/or downward-facing misinformation, which creates a better balance.

The real issue is naked shorting, which is illegal, but most-likely took place in the GME scenario.

That was a lot, but I hope it made sense.</text>

    <text>I'm not sure I completely understand your question, but nobody really "allows" shorting to exist, it's just that it's not illegal to lend shares to someone, and therefore shorting is a natural possibility.

Ultimately, it's a bit like an overdraft in a bank account, you can have -1 share in your brokerage account, as long as you pay that share back eventually.</text>

    <text>Shorting can be a good thing. Companies sometimes exaggerate their value or flat out lie about their financials, in order to drive their stock prices up. If an investor has reason to believe a company really isn’t as valuable as they portray, taking a short position can be a signal to other investors that things aren’t going well with the company. 

I’m not sure if anyone shorted Enron back when their shit hit the fan, but that’s the kind of situation where a short could be used in a smart AND relatively noble way.

Like most things in life, intention matters a lot. 

The hedge funds losing their asses right now have blatantly shown they’re willing to artificially tank businesses for their own short-term financial gain.  Their intentions are shit and no one feels bad for them except those who share the same moral compass</text>

So if I lent out a pie (regardless of its value), and you sell that pie to /u/Poem_for_your_sprog, and /u/Poem_for_your_sprog lends the pie to /u/gallowboob and /u/gallowboob sells it /u/spez... Now that pie is shorted 200% (or 300%?), because there is only 1 pie owed back to 2 people (both myself and to /u/Poem_for_your_sprog) but is in the possession of of a 3rd person (/u/spez).</text>

    <text>Short a stock has no expiration date. But your consequence is that you get to keep offering more and more money to buy that stock. If that price happens to be 400 or 4000 it doesn't matter when the piper calls and you have to give the stock back you have to pay whatever price you can get it for in this situation. That is why they are trying so hard to demonize wsb and retail in general. They have SIGNIFICANT incentive to get the price to drop as low as they can get it before they have to start paying potentially thousands per share</text>

    <text>I think that makes it a little clearer for me. Let me see if I got this.

So if the pie was $100 (I know, just run with it). A *lends* the $100 pie to B. B *sells* the $100 pie they never actually owned to C for the fair market price of $100 because they think the price will fall and then they can buy it back for less and pocket the difference when they return the lent stock to C (shorting, as I understand it). C *lends* the same pie to D and they do the same as B (only selling it to E instead of C).

Now prices of the pie don't drop, but they raise (nevermind that ~~GameStop~~ the pie is fairly stale and spoiled). People believe in the pie now, and they surge the price of the pie to $160 (60% more). Now B and D have to make up an additional 60% each (120% total) to buy back one stock each and return it to it's owner A and C (which B and D frankly should never have had the right to sell A and C's stocks in the first place). Is that right?

Also, could this theoretically have happened in two steps? A lends to B, B sells to C. The the price of the stock shoots up to $220 (120% more than $100 it was at) and that would be "shorting it 120%?"</text>

    <text>It’s not that simple. Shorts have no end. People have place bets on top of bets on top of bets pretty much. It starts out as I own this stock. Company A predicts that my stock will eventually go down so they “borrow” the stock from me and sale it to someone else. They have to pay interest on this loan if the stock rises so everyday it goes up they owe more interest and more until they decide to close out their loan. Other people can place bets on top of this shit. There are so many layers to this. But the thing is this whole fiasco should have never been allowed to happen.</text>

    <text>💡⚡ oooOOOOoook! So let me get this straight (I hope I got this)...

Because some of these stocks were lent out more than once and sold more than once, some stocks are owed to two or more people. This was done so egregiously that more stocks are owed back to people than stocks that exist. Did I finally get it?!?!

So if I lent out a pie, and you sell that pie  to /u/Poem_for_your_sprog, and /u/Poem_for_your_sprog lends the pie to /u/gallowboob and /u/gallowboob sells it /u/spez... Now that pie is shorted 200% (or 300%?), because there is only 1 pie owed back to 2 people (both myself and to /u/Poem_for_your_sprog) but is in the possession of of a 3rd person (/u/spez).</text>

    <text>Things are so extremely volatile that it's unlikely you'll be able to get through on the phone to place a sell order in time unless your advisor guarantees a response and action  within minutes.

GME went from 274 to 468 with 30 minutes this morning. Then 5 minutes later it went down to 401. Within 75 more minutes it went down to 152.

When price crashes on volatile stuff like this it crashes fast. And the current situation is unprecedented volatility.</text>

    <text>A better way to look at it is: say you’re a long term investor,  you don’t give a shit what happens in the time scale of months, you’re planning on holding stock X for 25 years as the business grows.

I’m a short term trader, I come to you and say “Hey, stock X is worth $5 right now, can I borrow 1000 of your stock X and sell them, and in two weeks I’ll give you back 1000 stock X, plus I’ll pay you 2% of the current value of the stocks every week until I return them?”

You say sure, cause either way you still have your 1000 stocks in two weeks, plus a little extra.  I borrow your stocks and sell them for $5000, hoping the price is going to drop.  Say the price drops to $1.  Now in two weeks I buy 1000 stocks, worth $1000, and give them back to you, plus pay you $200 as the 2% per week x $5000 x 2 weeks.  I’ve made $3800, you’ve made $200 and still have your stock, everyone wins except the dumbasses who bought the stock from me and lost all their money when it dropped.

On the other hand, if I bet wrong, and the stock skyrockets to $100 a share, two weeks comes around and I have to pay you the $200, *plus* I have to buy back all 1000 stocks to return to you, so I have to spend $100,000 to get back these stocks I sold for $5000, so I lose $95,000, you get your valuable stocks back, and I still have to pay you the interest fee I promised to convince you to lend me the stock.

This is what’s happening with GameStop stock.  Hedge funds borrowed metric shittons of GameStop stock, more than actually even exists on the market, because they were borrowing borrowed stock, expecting the price to drop.  WSB noticed this, combined with the company’s new CEO having relatively promising plans for the company, and bought tons of this borrowed stock with no intention of selling back to the hedge funds for less.  Now all this borrowed stock is stuck in the WSB people’s wallets, the stock price has skyrocketed due to the demand for the stock, and the hedge fund’s time to return their borrowed stock is coming due.  

The real bitch about it for the hedge funds is that there *isn’t enough stock on the market* to repay all their loans at once, making the demand far higher than the supply, driving the price even further up.  As a result, they’re legally obligated to offer higher and higher and higher amounts of money to get the stock from people who aren’t willing to sell until their price is reached.  WSB theoretically has them by the balls and gets to dictate the price the hedge funds will have to pay.</text>

    <text>"Margin" is a word that's used in a lot of different ways, but in the current news, it kind of means this.

I explained in another post that a brokerage basically manages all your stock certificates for you. So let's say that I'm a brokerage, and you've got a bunch a certificates the prove you own stock that I'm managing for you. You want some extra money to make a bet for or against a company. Because you're such a good customer, I'm willing to lend some money to you. If you don't pay me back, I've got your stock certificates, so I have some collateral I could take away from you: that makes me willing to loan you more money, because I know how screwed you'll be if you don't pay me back. So sure, I'll lend you some money to buy some stock or some options, as long as you have enough collateral.</text>

    <text>The problem that is being run into is that redditors are holding onto their stocks regardless of spikes in price. If you want to make money, you have to sell at the top of a spike. But if redditors start selling to make profits en masse, then the price plummets and people aren't making money anymore.

A short squeeze isn't indicative of the real value of a stock, so any money made in profit has to be realised as losses by someone else. The reason this doesn't happen normally is because shares have real value in dividends - I can sell at a price without the price dipping because the person buying really believes they can make that much money in dividends. That is not the case here, though.</text>

    <text>I'm no economist so you might want to take this with a grain of salt, but here goes:

That hedgefund? is most likely using it's own money or money it borrowed from it's broker, not from a bank, so the link is not that direct (and anyway even if it's from a bank, it wouldn't be the kind of bank you and I use, it would be a bank specializing in investments).

The 70B$ are not exactly 70B$ either, Hedge fund X borrowed the stocks from Hedge fund Y, the stock's actual value is around let's say 10$ and that's what hedge fund Y paid at the time when it bought it.

Let's say the stock's price rises to 200$ and hedge fund X can't pay that and goes under, let's say it owned 11$ in the bank, those 11$ get transferred to hedge fund Y to cover some of the debt. Yeah hedge fund Y didn't make the 190$ potential it was owed but it still made 1$.

Yeah some people paid 150$ to buy the stock along the way, but that money ended up in the hands of the seller, so it doesn't disappear when the stock's price drops, just changes hands.

Lastly, the government doesn't borrow money from banks, it issues bonds and sells them, it say something like "This bond is sold for 100$, the holder of this bond can claim 21$ a year from the government for a duration of 5 years since the moment the bond was issued" basically it's give me 100$ now and over 5 years I"ll give you 105$ , the government makes up the difference by collecting taxes from the people. It cares about the banks because the people hold their money in the banks, and so if they go under the people lose their money and so it can't collect taxes, not because banks lend it money directly.

So yeah everything in the economy is interconnected but there's like 1 or 2 or 3 degrees of separation between the various moving parts in the current story.</text>

    <text>&gt;It's not about getting money, it's about getting them to pay. Something like that?

Not really, you see WSB love the stock so much they believe GME is undervalued. Some of them believe the price is over 1k+. WSB can like stocks longer than Funds live on debt and they hate it when WSB dictate the terms. What do I know about markets? I just know WSB loves the stock and they are free to set a selling price.</text>

    <text>I think you are right. I feel like if the hedge fund peeps didn’t do anything, GameStop might have been headed towards bankruptcy in like 7-10 years. 

But also I have some hope for GameStop. It looks like they are trying to pivot and diversify. They are testing out some new designs for their stores. Trying to focus more on board games/tabletop games and social gaming.

They’ve stayed the same money-wise after all the recent console releases (I guess the thought was they would flop, because people would be more into digital only purchases on these devices). 

I think the pandemic also drove people back to buying discs. I was taking an economics class during the start of the pandemic and we saw that there was a spike in sales of physical books, DVDs, and CDs. I guess when economic crisis happen, people like tangibles. 

So people betting on digital only, I think we are further away than assumed.</text>

    <text>GME is GameStop , in the same way that AAPL is apple or NFLX is Netflix, you actually are buying part of the company


If you have a business and you’re the sole owner, you get to keep 100% of the profits that you make 

If for example you and 100 of your friends started a company (this is a simplification) , and all agreed you each get 1/100th of the profits 
So say the company made 1 million dollars , in scenario A you get 1 mil to yourself, in scenario B you get 10k

For a stock like GME, it’s the same except in the millions of shares 
The only difference is that if you want to sell your portion of the pie in the company, it’s only worth what somebody else is willing to pay for it. If I think it’s going to be a good investment for the future, I’ll buy at a higher price etc 
So the stock price doesn’t necessarily correlate with what the actual company is making

And in the case with the mess of this week, it’s because they bet with financial instruments that amplified it</text>

Remember when Japan was putting massive tariffs on apples from the USA?  $20USD/Apple in Tokyo....that’s the stock market.  Does that pricing stop farmers from growing apples in Sebastopol, California?   No.</text>

    <text>Thank you. I also simplified some concepts massively as these transactions are very complicated on paper. I have a finance degree but even so, I myself don’t fully grasp them to the fine print. But in theory the number of outstanding shares is what the market has available for purchase. Options are a contract between two independent parties, and they are zero sum transactions, meaning one party always looses. Gamestop doesn’t have help anyone fulfilling their end of the deal because the contract happens without gamestop’s knowledge or consent. You can literally make an option contract with anyone for whatever reason and its technically enforceable in court. its just a promise to be able to buy or sell at a set price. 

If the company or executives wanted to sell more stock from their private holdings they would have to basically ask permission by filing a report to the SEC and letting everyone know of their intentions. For a company already dealing with massive financial stress its a very risky move and that takes time to set up. But in theory they don’t have to do anything and most likely wont. Maybe if the price settles to somewhere low but stable we’ll see them try to raise more cash for equity but all of this will long have blown over by then.</text>

    <text>No, GME has no real say over their stock price other than by how they perform. They can issue stock but its not as simple as just printing more stock, they have to go through proper channels of the SEC to announce it. GME even then would have no control over these institutions freezing the sale of the stock, that was done because of SEC requirements of cash liquidity.

Its not a problem that there are too few shares per-se, its that the private funds that hated the stock were so sure that the price was going to go down that they borrowed the same stock multiple times and resold it. Now other people have bought those stocks and aren't selling them.

So now those private funds, that bet the stock would go down, have to find stocks to give back to the people that they borrowed them from. But since the "Regular Joes" that have since bought the stocks aren't selling them, those private funds now have to buy the stocks at higher and higher prices to cover their borrowed shares. Most of the time these private funds have borrowed the shares on margin IE a loan, to cover that loan they have to sell other positions in the market.

So the issue isnt that there are too few shares its that private funds got greedy and got caught. None of that is going to be solved by an issuance of more shares, and issuing more shares wouldnt be good for the stock or the market in general.

Finviz is really popular for sorting and finding stocks and is a great source of info. The issue thats  going on right now can be seen in the short float at -121%. So its over sold by 21%.

EDIT: To add the exact same thing could have happened if there 125 million shares or 10. The amount that of shares doesnt matter as much as how many shares were over sold. This wouldnt have happened at 101%.</text>

I keep seeing "Friday is the day that everything skyrockets", but the shorters are going to try to drag it out much longer than that. They are hoping GME shareholders eventually get scared of the volatility, or get bored and move on to the next meme.</text>

    <text>Most of the capital they're playing with is people who have dedicated people manage their investments for tax purposes/maximize gains (7+ figure networth probably isn't unlikely) because you need a dedicated relationship with them. 

It's not like just downloading robinhood, loading some cash and pressing some buttons. I think most regular person funds are diversified enough that this won't have too much of an impact (think overall market mutual funds, etc). Before this whole GME thing, the default stocks I was invested in were not heavily impacted by one or two companies spiking or dying.</text>

    <text>Let’s say bananas sell for $2 apiece.   I think the price will drop so I want to short it.   Let’s also say that there’s only 10 bananas in this world and PersonA owns them.   

I borrow those 10 bananas (and promise to pay PersonA back 10 bananas next week).   I sell those banana to PersonB and get $20.  If the price of banana drops to $1, I’ll buy 10 banana back for $10 and make $10 profit.   

Banana are now shorted at 100%.   

Let’s say PersonC also thinks banana prices will drop and wants to short bananas.  He borrow 5 bananas from PersonB and sells them to PersonD.  

Bananas are now shorted 150%.   

During the week, banana prices drop to $1 apiece.   PersonC needs to return 5 bananas to PersonB.   He buys 5 bananas from PersonD for $5, returns the 5 banana loan to PersonB.   

I need to return 10 bananas to PersonA so I buy 10 bananas from PersonB for $10 and return 10 bananas back to PersonA.</text>

    <text>You borrow 1000 shares to sell. But not from any one person. You just 'borrow'. At the same time, I too borrow 1000 shares and sell them. In real-life math, there should be someone who is less by 2000 shares net, but in this world, the 2000 shares just appear without depleting anywhere.

The problem comes next week when both of us need to  buy our 1000;shares each for real, to close our positions. Now since this really needs someone to sell 1000 + 1000 shares, there's some demand for it (from the two of us). If it really is a loser stock, you'd have a number of sellers. But if nobody sells it, both is us are frantic to buy, and are willing to pay a higher price.</text>

    <text>Yep!  They “borrowed” 2 shares from you  even though you only own one.  So they buy one share to pay you back and then basically have to buy that same exact share from you to pay you back again.  How much would you be willing to sell them a share that they have no other choice to buy from?

For an interesting experiment, Google “the dollar Bill auction” to see how quickly something like this can happen!  It’s a fascinating cautionary tale.</text>

    <text>Maybe.. but shorting it by 140% just doesn't seem right at all.  There should be a hardcap for the amount of stocks you can short (maybe 20% to 30%).. Because after a certain point you are just trying to drive the stock so low to a point where the shareholder has no choice but to abandom ship even if the company can still function.</text>

    <text>if i am a billion dollar hedge fund and  my interest is to keep a share low I would start talking to the press and saying this stock is reaaaaally dangerous because of its inestability, at the same time I would create an artificial panic by selling  in really short time  a relatively small amount of shares to start making the price go down, just enough to make people nervous and provoque them to sell their own shares thus, driving the price even lower, and continuing until I reach my goal, which is what they are doing now. The difference is that people are not falling for that</text>

    <text>This is all theoretical, but the brokers who loaned the hedge funds the share could step in and say “this shit has gone on long enough - we want our shares back” and just make the hedge funds rebuy the shares in the market. Or they could take the collateral and do it themselves. 

The part I don’t know is how big the short position is relative to the hedge funds total assets. If I have $20B in assets and my short exposure is $100 million, the brokers might not cut me off for a long, long time. I have a lot of assets, so even if the share price goes to the moon, and my exposure doubles, there is still a lot of collateral to take.

Where it gets dicey is if my short exposure is $100 million and I have $150 million in assets. If it doubles, I’m basically underwater. My broker might step before it gets to that point.

EDIT: If shit really gets bad, they use all the funds other assets to repay their obligations.</text>

Does that mean Bob had 10 shares originally? And when he lends them, does that mean Bob can still sell them to make money like Alec? Sorry if this is a stupid question. I know nothing about the economy and finance and things like that but I've been trying to teach myself.</text>

    <text>The craziest thing is it’s even scammier than that. From my understanding, a more accurate analogy would be:  
I own 10 pieces of candy. You *sell* those 10 candies today to a third person with the promise that in a week, you’re going to buy the candy from me and deliver it to them. Your hope is that in a week, I will be selling the candy for less than what you sold it for today.  
So it’s not even that you’re selling borrowed candy. It’s that you’re selling candy you never even owned.</text>

    <text>It’s important to note that that’s only one side of the shorting business. The other side corrects real overvaluation and uncovers company misdeeds.</text>

    <text>Probably not, but I am not a lawyer lol. From where I see it there’s no difference between this and someone just doing it individually, as long as the donors know exactly what they’re donating to. 

The only issue with the setup is that there is only a return on investment once you sell the GME shares, and the whole point of investing right now is to invest with the intention of holding the shares for a long time so hedge funds lose money. If you sell the shares for some profit (which is up to you) it would be going against the general idea that started this whole scenario. 

Finally I’ll add that it’s unlikely that investing in GME now, so late into the scenario, will show any decent ROI and you may lose all your money given how volatile the stock is right now. You’d probably be better off investing in a mutual fund or crypto or something if you’re trying to raise money for charity this way.</text>

    <text>the squeeze in a short squeeze has nothing to do with the lender. It's all about loss heat on the shorter, since losses on shorts can be practically infinite, the higher the price goes, the more and more the shorter is under pressure to cover, and once the shorter finally covers and becomes a buyer, thats when they've been squeezed.</text>

    <text>Are there standard lengths of time that shorts can last for before they expire, or is that something negotiated with the hedge fund and the borrowers?  
With the current frenzy, does that mean the hedge funds trying to short gamestop are expiring soon so that's why there is a panic?  I assume it wouldn't be this large of an issue if the expiration date was in a few years time as it would give the stocks time to simmer down.. would I be correct in that?</text>

Instead since I purchased it the shirt has been on clearance for $5 so all I get is $5 and lost $15?  But of course on a much bigger scale and obviously more convoluted. Am I close?</text>

    <text>This isn't true at all.  Shorting is acting on the speculation that something will decrease in value.  That decline may have nothing what-so-ever to do with the thing being shorted.

Let's say there is a horrible pig virus, causing the piglets to die young.  The supply of pig meat is going to be limited, meaning the price per pig will be high (because there aren't very many pigs).

Now, imagine a pig vaccine is developed that cures the pig virus.

You may speculate that the number of pigs on the open market will radically increase in the months after the vaccine is rolled out causing the price per pig to drop.

You may opt to open a short position to profit from the expected decline in the price of pigs.

It's the same for stocks, and is a natural consequence of a market.

If nobody had the ability to profit during a time of decline, the market would stall.  This is analogous to saying that things may only ever be sold for profit, and never a loss.  Markets don't work like that.</text>

    <text>So for your first reason, I am assuming the shorts that the hedge funds made are expiring soon, which is why WSB holding their shares makes it a terrible situation for them?  Is it public knowledge when these kinda shorts expire or we can only assume?

In the second reason, are you saying that it is possible that the borrowers are telling the hedge funds that there is no way for you to pay us more than the $70bil+ that you're losing from your short so pay us back now or post some collateral to help cover your losses?</text>

    <text>Several things:

1. There is no guarantee it will be worth less when returned than when loaned out. It's very possible for shortsellers to lose money. 

2. Many shareholders buy shares intending to hold them for many years regardless of price movement (buy and hold). If my investment plan is to hold AAPL for 20 years and sell at retirement age, then a short borrowing and returning the shares during that time is of no consequence to me. The fees that I collect from them are, from my perspective, pure profit.</text>

    <text>So the plan to hold on to gamestop stocks to screw hedge funds over depends on whether borrowers make a margin call now while the stock is high?  Provided that their short isn't expiring soon (which it doesn't sound like it)..?

Do we know that the borrowers are making these margin calls now?</text>

    <text>Great explanation. I've read that the short/gamma squeeze is supposed to occur tomorrow. What does that mean for the manager and what would it mean for the redditors who have a few shares?  


Based on my understanding (very average at best), this looks like it's going to swing the ways of the redditors and Gamestop will, in fact, keep going up while the managers trying to short will be massively out of pocket?</text>

    <text>So the lender "lends" the stock to the borrower at a given interest rate (normally something relatively high). So when the lender received their stock back, they get the initial stock (which may have gone up or down in value) plus some interest for lending the stock.</text>

    <text>&gt; WSB and some other investors see Gamestop not as mall-centric brick and mortar, but a potential e-commerce powerhouse in the gaming sector, which is really taking off. Essentially what Amazon did for books, they think Gamestop will do for gaming. They think future earnings will be much much higher than they are now.

That is absolutely not why everyone is crazy buying Gamestop stocks right now. It's due to hedge funds being now forced to buy the stocks in the future at ANY price.

    <text>So now that this thing blew up and has gone viral, let's imagine people will hold on the bought shares on and on and on. Would it be possible that the share price will go so much high up and that the hedge fund debt be so overwhelming that the HF won't have money to buy the loaned shares? I mean, *if* people keep holding, is it possible for this thing to become big enough to generate a decent sized crisis?</text>

Supply/demand. The price goes up. 

Their shorts mean they HAVE to buy. But we don’t have to sell. In the meantime, it’s costing them a fortune to remain in their present position (costs money to ‘borrow’ these shares for their short). It costs us nothing.

    <text>You can be in a short position for a long time but there are certain circumstances where you have to end that position.


If the price gets too high the broker is going to have to force the hedge fund to pay out. 


The deal with the short is that you borrowing a stock and selling it and at some point you have to return it. That point is nearing, they have a set amount expiring every week for the next few weeks.</text>

Also every single day the share price is higher than what the borrowed it for they have to pay the difference of. It’s been costing them billions of dollars a day and they are bound to run out of money soon.</text>

    <text>However the hedge funds may have already covered their position so this could just collapse by the end of the day.

And yes, short interest is growing but that means more people are shorting. Probably looking longer term since no one thinks this price can be sustained without a squeeze or bubble.</text>

    <text>Only familiar with the UK, sorry, but because a company like Gamestop is publicly listed (i.e. you can buy their shares on an exchange), there are restrictions on the new shares it decides to issue. E.g. have to offer its existing shareholders the new shares first unless they go through a certain procedure, pass certain resolutions requiring shareholder votes

It's called a secondary issue of shares (i.e. after the IPO) if you want to look it up.</text>

    <text>For question two, issuing more stock decreases the value of the stock. When someone says Company is worth $XXXX, that amount is determined by the number of shares multiplied by the shares current value on the stock market.

Another way to look at it is the Company, as a whole, is made up of 100%. If there are 100 shares, each share is worth 1%. If the company decided to make 100 more shares, then each share is worth 0.5%.

What this is, basically, is called a "stock split". It happens sometimes when the cost of individual stock is so high, the company decides to do a 2-for-1 or 3-for-2 split. It drops the price of the stock, but makes more stock available to be purchased by investors to the company. There are certainly some reasons why a company would want to do this, and it has happened before.

If a stock splits on a 2-for-1, and you have 25 shares at the time, your 25 shares are actually now 50 shares, and the price of the stock tends to drop in a like amount. So if the stock was $100 dollars before the split, it would likely be around $50 after -- though this is very simplified.</text>

Not an expert at all, but I guess you could make money from dividends. You see a stock is just a percentage of the company (albeit a pretty small one) and thus you are entitled to it's profits.</text>

    <text>&gt; In this situation, however, Joe Blow's $1000 investment in GameStop is now worth $50,000. Multiply that by a few tens of thousands of users and you've created a potentially catastrophic level of risk sitting between the broker and the market-maker. So, Robbinhood's market-makers forced them (and others) to stop trading.

    <text>When you borrow a stock, you are saying "Hey, let me take this stock home, and I will pay you $10 next week." This is called short selling, or shorting.

What short sellers try to do, is they buy the stock for $10, because they know that the stock is gonna drop to $5 because the company is dieing, so they sell the stock to someone else while the price is still $10, and when it drops to $5 next week, they come back and say "Hey, your stock is only worth $5 now, so I only owe you $5 for it". He gives the company $5 and then keeps the extra $5 he made by selling it to the random chump for $10.

Most brokers offer the option to borrow stocks. The interest you have to pay on borrowed stocks is different between firms. It works differently for hedge funds, but I'm not sure how.</text>

    <text>"When a stock that is sold short rises dramatically, lenders start to ask for their stock back. That means short sellers have to buy GameStop to close their position, driving the stock up further. Also, some of the buyers from Reddit and elsewhere were not directly buying GameStop stock but were buying call options — the right to buy GameStop stock at a higher price. But as the stock goes up, the firm on the other side of these trades purchases more GameStop stock to hedge its position. All three of these factors created a feedback loop that caused GameStop's meteoric rise on Tuesday. "

Short sellers are the ones selling at a loss? Why would they want the right to buy stocks at a high price? Don't you want to buy at a low price and sell at a high price?</text>

    <text>'Degrossing', or in simpler words: deleveraging  


They reduce other positions to remain within their personal risk tolerance.   


This is why the market sold off heavily. They close both longs and shorts at the same time. It becomes a liquidation waterfall.   


One fund starts selling longs/buying back shorts. Prices decrease/increase. Other funds have to do the same... prices go more down/up... You get the gist</text>

They COULD  have bought call options way outside the money to put an upper limit on their losses.  Then they take their lumps and exercise those call options to cover their shorts.  They may be sitting on call options for all I know, or maybe they were greedy and didn't cap the risk they were taking at all.  

Now?  I think now they're fucked.</text>

It may go up if the company offers additional shares for purchase

It may go up if the stock splits

It may go down if the company buys back shares

It may go down if there's a reverse stock split.

    <text>I mean being at the forefront of a national movement for a week will definitely increase popularity for the next months, but on a quarterly financials basis, the rising stock price means nothing for revenue. Theoretically if GameStop was having cash issues they can try and issue new stock now to capitalize on the higher price, but it will dilute the outstanding shares and make the price drop, which could spook people off. Otherwise, it means nothing for the profitability of the business.</text>

    <text>&gt; Companies don't usually buy their own shares back,

Er, do you read financial headlines? Until Covid hit, one of the big issues was companies that used their profits (and even borrowed money in some cases!) to buy back their own stocks, instead of investing in new plants or products. In 2018, the record so far, companies bought back *$770 billion* of their own stock. Since 2015, the amount is close to $2 trillion, and you say "companies don't usually buy their own shares back"? What would it take to convince you?

*In fact, the amount of capital that these companies are plowing into buybacks has grown at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.4 percent since 2015. This compares with annual growth over the same time period of 7.1 percent for dividends, 5.5 percent for organic investment, and 1.4 percent for cash acquisitions.* - https://www.treasuryandrisk.com/2020/06/04/corporate-stock-buybacks-hit-record-levels</text>

    <text>This is a great metaphor, except that the hedge funds didn't do anything even dubiously immoral (except being a hedge fund, which is enough for some people), but bet pretty hard that gamestock shares would go down. WSB saw that they'd over bet so worked together to increase the price to make a short squeeze happen, and are now upset that after they continue to manipulate the market the exchanges are calling them out on their market manipulation.

  
So a better metaphor is:

Wall St got seen putting a bunch of money on the red squares on a roulette wheel; WSB decided to screw them over so bet on black and put their dick in the roulette wheel to force it to land on black, and are now complaining when Wall St asks that they remove their dick from the roulette wheel, by trying to claim that they saw Wall St do the same (which they have no proof of).</text>

    <text>With the renewed interest in the stock market/ sticking it to "the man" people are focusing their attention on other things that might have as meteoric a rise as gamestop. Dogecoin is an altcoin that has some attention thanks to a jump not too long ago. It was marked as something that might rise, and then the people that said it'd rise sold at that higher price. They 'pumped' the price up, then 'dumped' their dogecoin.</text>

    <text>Not exactly nothing to certain people.

People like high executives, such as the CEO, CFO, etc., are sometimes paid in stock options, or have stock given to them as bonuses, etc. If they have 1000 shares, and it is at 20 dollars, they have, effectively, $20,000. If it rises to 300, then it's worth $300,000.

There is some clout in that money that can be used in various ways.</text>

    <text>Doge coin is a crypto currency similar to bitcoin, except it really only exists to be a joke. People are trying to make it seem like dogecoin will be the next big thing to rocket up in price, and if you buy now, you'll be able to resell later at a much higher price. These people are generally lying and trying to get others to buy and drive up the price, so they can sell at a high price before everyone else they've lied to realizes what a terrible decision buying dogecoin was and the price crashes again.

They pump up word on the street about the stock. And then they dump what they own on all the newly hyped buyers.</text>

    <text>Typically, you create an account and can add funds relatively easily. Some require additional identification (e.g. email them your drivers licence) but usually you are ready to go within a few days

Once your account is live, you can add funds and start trading pretty much immediately. Withdrawing funds is sometimes made a little more tricky on some platforms (they make it a little less straightforward, but nothing a quick google didn't solve), and usually takes a few days of processing.</text>

    <text>The account you make on one of those apps would be the special account. You'll need to provide some info like your SSN and usually driver's license or ID to have your account approved. With ones like Robinhood approval is fast and pretty much guaranteed to go through. With more "grown up" brokers approval may take several days.

You would fund your account by providing your bank info, not with debit or credit card.</text>

    <text>I saw a post where u/Springoniondip said:
"Hedge Funds tried to make GameStop bankrupt by betting that their shares would go to a low value. R/wallstreet bets picked up on that and kept buying more and more shares driving the value up. This meant that the hedge funds had to keep purchasing stocks back at a higher price (shorting is above my brain but I think that’s how it works). The hedge funds ended up losing 30B apparently, and now all the financial institutions are freaking out that normal people beat the industry at its own game" 
Basically, GameStop was doing bad, Wall Street bet big on their Stock going down, and Reddit Saw its opportunity to Duck those guys by buying a bunch of stock so the price goes up instead.</text>

    <text>The non-payment of any cash collateral entitles the lender to immediately terminate the loan and exercise is rights to recover its losses under the loan contract. Now, the lender could technically demand the delivery of the securities (since that was the original obligation) but in practice the whole point of the cash collateral is to make that unnecessary because the correct amount of compensation is ready and waiting in the lender's bank account. Furthermore, in the current situation, the lender would have to be insane to demand delivery of the securities because as soon as they are delivered they will be worthless because the short position is gone and GME share price will tank. Massively better to have the cash. Even if this were not the case, a court would be unlikely to enforce delivery of securities when sufficient cash compensation is available because it's unnecessarily onerous on the borrower.</text>

    <text>You open a brokerage account with a broker (like Robinhood, Schwab, Fidelity, Ameritrade, whatever).  

It's conceptually a lot like a bank account, except you can buy stocks with the money in the account.

If you want to do less normal stuff (e.g. shorting, options, margin), then I think there's another step where you have to get approved.  But that part certainly isn't required

There are tax implications to all of this... just like you have to pay taxes on the interest earned from a savings account, you have to pay taxes on gains you make in the stock market.</text>

    <text>This makes perfect sense but my understanding of the GME situation is that it seems to be an anomaly that the prices go down - I thought Hedge funds did this on the assumption the stock would go down, therefore the share returned is worth less... perhaps other people in this thread saying they charge interest on the time helps this make more sense in the way it 'normally' plays out.

    <text>By supply and demand of the market. If people think the price will go up, they buy, thus helping the price go up and vice versa. A lot of stock value is placed in the opinion of the shareholders. That's why watching the news and seeing good news about a companies profits or a new product can cause a surge in price. Then, some of those people will want to sell because they think it's peaked, this may cause the price to drop as other shareholders may follow.</text>

    <text>There are some technicalities by which you are incorrect.

A short vs a long is purely how long you hold the stock. If you sell within a year of buying, any profit is taxed like income (short). If you sell more than a year after buying, any profit is taxed as capital gains (long).

Your description of short selling (or shorting) was correct, but the other thing is in no way a long, and holding long is irrelevant to the gamestop situation.</text>

Which raises an interesting question: if the value of a share is made up essentially of faith, what true connection - if any - does it have to the underlying business fundamentals?

I argue: Nothing.

The stock market could dry up and blow away and tomorrow Gamestop would still be around - its employees working, its stores opening, its PS5s selling - and still modestly losing money.</text>

    <text>In buy low/sell high, if the stock goes up in price, is the reason that you profit because the broker wants to accrue shares that they think they can later sell at a higher price?

Or is it that the broker receives a bid on a share at a higher price, so they buy your share to sell to an existing bidder? What happens if the broker buys your share and then nobody wants the stock anymore? Does the broker lose money?</text>

    <text>This is actually a made up narrative and this has everything to do with the the fundamentals of GameStop. Increased revenue from console sales and an activist investor willing to turn their business model online meant investors were willing to buy in and bet the shorts would lose. When shorts lose stock price gets a boost. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4370860-gamestop-short-squeeze This article was written in August when most people on WSB still thought GameStop was the next Blockbuster and were all shorting GameStop as well. The narrative shifted when the stock price rose based on positive expectations, and the only shorts who could afford to remain short were the hedge funds. At this point hedge funds doubled down by further shorting the stock. The hedge funds did this to themselves. Without positive fundamentals for GameStop none of this ever happens. The narrative that WSB just did this to fuck with hedge funds only lends credence to the idea that it was stock market manipulation, which is bullshit. Source: I’ve been invested in GME since $4 in July. I’ve searched every GameStop stock related article daily since. This was a grassroots movement with no guarantees based on the underlying idea that GameStop was not a bankrupt company without a future, it was a bet and we bet right, they bet wrong. Now they don’t want to pay.</text>

    <text>Yes and no.

Crypto is decentralized and a currency, meaning it can be divided up into smaller pieces. You can't really give me half a stock and give me the ability to treat it as if it's a full stock*

Also, could you short sell a cryptocurrency? I guess. You could bet on a crypto to go down just like a stock would go down, but it's a lot more impractical. 

Say you have a company that has it's stocks listed and what not and is operating. Let's say that it makes paperclips. 

That simple company itself has so, so many reasons why its stock price could go both up and down. Maybe the supply lines get interrupted due to COVID? Literal modern day pirates stealing the shipment of paperclips that were meant to go from Asia to Europe? Maybe a factory burns down or shitty working conditions cause the workers to go on strike so the conditions are worse. A new CEO for Paperclip Inc., maybe? Maybe they come out with a revolutionary new paperclip that's cheaper to produce!

You name it. All these things affect how a companies stock values go up and down. There's so much information that can be (ab)used. With cryptocurrencies there still is a lot of information too: From the platforms who will start accepting them as payment making them more useful (and valuable) to one or many people dropping their "hoard" of crypto making it a lot cheaper due to more supply and equal demand.

But it's not as much, in many cases the others are anonymous, and above all it's not something that is easily or reliably predicted contrary to what many people want you to believe. 

I'm expecting the crypto market to move more towards the Forex market rather than the stock market, as Forex deals in currencies and crypto literally is a currency. 


*Sometimes "more" stocks are created and what, but it's not the same principle.


Edit; it surely isn't impossible to sell BTC in hopes of buying it back later at a lower price of course, but it's far from reliable.</text>

    <text>Remember that GameStop can at any point issue new shares at these prices and raise a large amount of capital for further growth and acquisitions.

They might not be worth 500$ at current evaluation, but it sure as hell wasn't worth 5$ either, like the short sellers would have you belive. 

This rapid increase works in GameStops favor! Those getting in at 290$ will only loose if they sell below, and i have no problem seeing gamestop reach 300-400$ on a fundamental level in the near future.</text>

    <text>So if the price is getting inflated, in part due to reddit's viral information getting people to invest and then also the feedback loop of people trying to cover their short position, wouldn't that mean now would be a good time to short it?

The people originally shorting it did so out of a belief it was overvalued, now it is being inflated due to all this market manipulation. Surely it will at some point level out and then once all these people close out their positions (no idea if I'm using that correctly) it would start to return to a realistic value?</text>

    <text>&gt; I personally worry for some who “got in at 290” because at the end of all this they will be SOL

The reason it defies "market efficiency" is twofold.  One: demand exceeded supply and for whatever reason (likely bureaucratic) Gamestop can't increase supply to meet demand.  Two: WSB is now hellbent on remaining irrational longer than Melvin can remain solvent.  To them, getting in at $290 is cheaper than a trip to Disneyworld and twice as thrilling and they'll ride this rocket until it crashes into the ocean in flames if they can take Melvin with them.</text>

    <text>Yes technically it should go up when people buy, supply and demand. Only thing here is that GameStop actually is a bad company, losing money like crazy and is worth like 10$ at most. The reason it’s so high is because the big hedge funds on wall streets made bets against stocks they thought would drop massively (even go bankrupt), which were amc, GameStop, Nokia , Blackberry Etc. Which makes sense, with the pandemic and future of retail they’re going to lose money
The thing is that they got so fucking greedy that they bet more than the amount of shares in existence, so by people like the normal average joe buying and holding , they further reduce the amount of shares on the market and is skyrocketing the price, because the hedge funds NEED the stock for their contract that expires tomorrow</text>

    <text>It goes up if you make a trade for a price that is higher than the previous one. If you want to buy a stock, you place an order which has a limit, which is the highest price you‘re willing to pay. Now your buy order is on the books. Once someone places a sell order with a price that‘s below your limit, your order will be executed and a trade will be made between you and the person who sells the stock.
Now if there‘s lots of people who want to buy and not a lot who want to sell, you have to offer more money to outbid the other buyers and get the stock.</text>

    <text>There was a bit of real company movement with a Chewy rep moving onto the board. Other than that, a single dude bought $57K of stock and kept reporting daily, which got a bit of hype. Then slowly this war came up because it turns out the people driving the stock into the ground were illegally betting against it. Basically loss for company = gain for them. 

Reddit got spiteful and opportunistic, Elon musk tweeted about it, the people who drove the stock downward illegally got spiteful and heavy-handed with misinformation to on the 28th what was public, textbook market manipulation because it's cheaper to get fined thank go bankrupt. 

No one this late in the game will profit. It's only to screw over the illegal betters.</text>

    <text>Pretty much, if you buy a stock it goes up by a very small amount, so if many people buy it’s grows. That’s why on WSB they say hold and don’t sell, so that the price doesn’t drop</text>

    <text>&gt; I think in the movie, the protagonists are just portrayed as being really smart and ahead of the curve. They're putting in their own money to say the economy is going to fall. Which is a totally fine thing to do.

It still feels vulturish of them to have done that, especially since it's basically betting a bunch of people will get fucked over on the one asset they actually have.</text>

    <text>What I always wondered is what is the benefit of a shareholder after the initial stock offering? I get that leagally the stock holder has the right the be the owner for ever, but it seems like such a bad deal to have to pay interest forever for an initial influx of cash. Should't there be a payback time as for loans?</text>

    <text>If you sell part of your company as stock, and the public likes it, it makes the stock you retain worth more.  Bezos is much richer with 11% of his company than he was when he owned all of it because the public really liked it.  You might not score as big as Bezos, but you still have established how valuable your company is, and can borrow on its value. 

It also lets your initial investors cash out.</text>

    <text>Imagine shares of stock being a deck of cards. There are 52 cards in total, and various people own the cards - some people own 1 card, some own 8, etc. Suppose they all trade cards with each other. The market capitalization of the company would be like multiplying whatever the price was on the most recent trade by 52. There might be someone sitting there who owns 12 cards and never trades them - we could still estimate the value of his holdings by multiplying 12 times whatever the most recent trade is. 


When a bubble crashes, it's like that guy with 12 cards, who NEVER traded, suddenly realizes he's worth a lot less money than he used to be. When that happens to people, they tend to try and cut their losses - they sell anything illiquid, and try to hoard cold hard cash. Imagine you found out that you'd just lost your job - you'd decrease your spending, right? No more Ubers? That's what happens when the bubble bursts. Everyone spends less, and thus the economy crashes.

Generally, governments are able to ameliorate those crashes by essentially printing a lot of money and "giving" it to people (building bridges or whatever). The problem we face now is, Trump increased the debt to $21trm while he was in office, and the budget deficit is enormous, so it's hard to see what more they can do at this point.</text>

    <text>A: The likelihood of it rising to even 1k is too low to even consider.

B: when you invest in a stock, that money goes into a pool of all the other people's money who invested in the stock. Investing in the stock drives the price up, selling drives it down, kind of like the updoot/downdoot function in reddit.

C: The idea is to wait until the price reaches a satisfactory price point, then to pull out that amount per share. So the price is basically covered already. You can pull or buy at any time for any reason, barring sketchy market manipulation.</text>

    <text>The DTCC is a federal regulatory body that covers the stocks for the broker-client transaction. That is apparently one of the reasons the markets froze today in regards to buying GME and AMC as well as some others. 

The DTCC must have cash in hand to cover the actual cost of the stock, which then they try to collect from Melvin Capitol, the hedge fund that shorted 140% of the volume of a stock.</text>

    <text>Basically, a hedge fund burrowed some stock of a company called GameStop (the stock is called GME). They then sold the stock. Their plan was to then wait for the stock value to fall, buy it back and return it. They would then make money by selling high and buying low. An investment/meme reddit sub called WallStreetBets decided to buy the stock and doing so raised its price. Now the broker still needs to buy the stock back to return it, but because the price is so high they could end up losing billions. The redditors might end up rich but they aren't selling yet, they are waiting for the price to rise more.</text>

    <text>The price of a stock only goes up when people (retail) or financial institutions (hedge funds, banks,etc.) are willing to pay a higher price to obtain it.  This is called “demand”.  

Nobody “owes” anything once you buy a stock (unless you used margin, which is is similar to, but more complicated than a credit card).

How do people “pull” their money?  This is not the right question.  The stock market is not an ATM.  Once you buy shares, There is no money.  There is only the shares of stock you own and the price that others are willing to pay for it.  If you want to sell your shares for what others are willing to pay, you trade your shares for money.</text>

So I have two questions. This one is a bit ambiguous -- is anyone in the wrong here? I feel like short stocking on the whole is a tricky piece of business and may not be completely fair, but I'm not sure.

Second: Are these Clearing Houses specific to companies? For example, is a certain Clearing House set aside for GameStop, or does the company share a Clearing House with other companies? If so, is it the owner of the Clearing House that earns the money from interest or the company?</text>

    <text>Isn't this just fraud? Selling something you don't have. Or in the case of shorts selling something you don't own. And in some cases selling a borrowed share multiple times to different people with the promise to the owner that you will return it? It seems like you have defrauded the people you sold the borrowed share to since the short has implications to the stock that is being concealed from the buyer.</text>

    <text>TL;DR: a group of redditors went up against the ultra rich on Wall Street and were winning until the apps that let them buy and sell stock purposely sabotaged them.

A few redditors on r/wallstreetbets started posting about hedge funds (which are businesses that invest money for the ultra rich and get to play by special rules and get special treatment because of how much money they have when they put all their ultra rich clients together) massively shorting (which is when hedge funds borrow shares of a stock from people who own them and agree to give the shares back on a specific date and pay them some interest for their trouble, sell the shares of the stock immediately upon receiving them with the belief that the stock is going to go down in price and they can buy the same number of shares of that stock back for less money and pocket the proceeds after returning the shares to their owners as agreed) GameStop (AMC and Nokia got added at some point). These redditors knew this because when hedge funds short a stock, it’s public. A lot of people get upset that shorting a stock is even a thing, because once it becomes public knowledge that these big hedge funds for the ultra rich are betting against a stock’s price rising, it almost becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy with other people who own the stock selling it off in drove which then lowers the price (because the demand for the stock lowers) and the rich hedge fund people just get richer. Anyway, a lot of people from the subreddit decided to see if they could stop the hedge fund people from winning their bet and profiting off their short by, instead of letting the normal thing happen when a short is announced and the stock being sold off, bought up a bunch of shares of the stock so the price went way up. 

Then most of them held onto the stock instead of selling it off at a massive profit because that would have lowered the price and potentially allowed the hedge funds to win their bet by shorting the stock. So now Robinhood and other retail stock markets (these are how the average, non-ultra rich people can buy and sell stocks) decided to get involved. They stopped allowing anyone to buy shares in GameStop, forceably sold off some shares without the consent of the people who bought them, and made it so the only thing retail (not ultra rich) owners of shares of GameStop stock could do was sell, thus protecting the hedge funds from major losses of money when they lost their bet and manipulating the stock market for the protection of the ultra rich and hurting the average users of their app.

Now, in response to this, there are members of the Us House and Senate calling for the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC, which is the federal agency who oversees the stock market) to investigate of what Robinhood and others did was illegal market manipulation. Also, there has been a class action lawsuit filed against Robinhood (a class action lawsuit is where one person who has legal standing—that is, was somehow hurt or impacted by another in a negative way that the law protects against—sues on behalf of themselves and others in their position for various reasons including meeting the minimum required amount of money asked for in recompense to be heard in court).</text>

    <text>Limit is for when you want to sell when it reaches a certain price like your example. Stop limit is set below and is meant to stop your losses. So you buy at 5 and set a stop limit for 3 so if drops your shares will be sold and you wont lose everything. Stop limits aren't exact since it may go straight to 0 and skip over 3 and you would get nothing.</text>

* Scenario A: GME price rises over $1000, wsb sells making big STONKS, Hedge funders lose billions and go bankrupt.
* Scenario B: GME price goes down to fundamentals, wbs loses a lot of money, Hedge funders close positions with minimal losses.
* Scenario C,D,E,F....Z: anything between scenario A and B.

Political:

* Scenario A: Big groups of people are regulated, no more investment talking over social media.
* Scenario B: Corpos are regulated, no more blatant market manipulation.
* Scenario C: A and B at the same time.</text>

    <text>In addition to what others have said, there are [margin requirements](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/shortmarginrequirements.asp) to sell stock short. These are calculated based on the value of the short position. As positions are marked to market, margin requirements are recalibrated. If the stock price has risen, the margin requirements increase, and short sellers will need to post additional collateral if their accounts fall below the new maintenance margin level. If the stock keeps rising, then short sellers will keep having to top up their accounts. At a certain point they'll have to cut their losses or risk running out of money - the question is whether the stock price will get high enough to force them to do so.</text>

    <text>A user /u/deepfuckingvalue bought into GameStop over year and a half ago because he thought the company could turn around. A lot of people criticized him...others sorta rallied around him. He continued to invest in GameStop, his first screenshots posted had $52k invested.

2020 hit and pandemic forced even more closure of retail stores, but deepfuckingvalue persisted. It stayed at around $4 pre-pandemic and post-dip of the pandemic. 

Then in mid-late 2020 year, Ryan Cohen, the co-founder of Chewy, was appointed as CEO to help turn GameStop into an online retailer for games, buying 9 million shares when it was ~$4 per share. /r/Wallstreetbets kept seeing /u/DeepFuckingValue's posts and saw this as a good thing and the price shot up to $15-20 per share and it became more of a meme stock. 

Hedge funds still thought GameStop was a lost cause and placed their bets on it returning to very low prices if not bankruptcy. But they did so egregiously that there literally weren't enough shares to cover this bet. Some people saw this and realized if shares continued to be purchased, the price would go up and hedge funds would get royally screwed, as they would be FORCED to purchase the stock at whatever price it was.

TLDR. deepfuckingvalue believed in the stock and got in very early. The company appointed Cohen/became meme stock and people got in and it made some money. Others continued to hop on the train and realized hedge funds were shorting the stock heavily, compounding the price.

After all this, /u/deepfuckingvalue continues to hold his positions, yesterday being up (at least) $47 million dollars on his $53k investment. People continue to hold both to say a big fuck you to hedge funds as well as relying on this increasing the stock price. The only way to continue to say fuck you to the hedge funds is to hold and continue buying the stock.</text>

    <text>They can (and often do) hold their short positions for months or years. This long term short strategy tends to put pressure on the stock to go down and, eventually, bankruptcy often becomes inevitable due to heavy shorting.

That said, if they get over leveraged (in too much debt) and the person who loaned them the shares in the first place is worried about them not being able to pay their debts, they can get a "margin call". A margin call means they have to pay off their debts by buying back the shares they borrowed. This is what we're hoping will happen to the shorts, causing a squeeze.</text>

    <text>The share price continues to rise as long as people who own the shares continue to hold. Those holding are now the price setters, and they can just keep upping the ask price further and further up. The funds want shares to cover their positions, so demand i FAR exceeding supply. That’s the “squeeze” you may have been hearing about.</text>

    <text>u/inch7706 gave the right answer. Just like any other loan the short sellers have to pay a premium (interest) for selling the shares short. The longer the stock price stays above their borrow price the more money they hemorrhage. This is why r/wallstreetbets is trying to drive and keep the price up. Eventually the short sellers won't have the capital to remain in the short so they will have to close out their short position by buying back the shares that they borrowed forcing the price to go higher (short squeeze)</text>

    <text>When someone says that they have short the stocks. It means they didn't own the stock at first place. They borrowed the stocks and sold them and now hoping that price will come down. Meanwhile borrowing has its own cost i.e. interest. So until they pay those stocks back they have to pay interest. So basically they are screwed from both sides.</text>

    <text>Because at some point after the short positions are settled, everybody at WSB will sell their positions. If you hold too long, theory suggests the market will eventually correct itself. Buying now and selling at market value (if currently 10x overvalued) will leave you with a massive loss</text>

    <text>Long read, but this is what happened.

Short sellers led by Melvin capital short sold GME shares to such an extent that shorted shares were 140% of the available shares. 

How short selling works is, you borrow shares from an owner willing to lend his shares, and sell them because you expect share prices to drop in the future. The idea is to buy the same shares back in the future when they're cheaper, and return them to the owner, closing the trade. Meanwhile, you pay some interest until you've returned the shares. Your profit is (price of shares sold - price of shares rebought - interest cost paid).

Now because they've shorted more shares than actually exist, they've completely skewed the demand-supply ratio unnaturally and they're forced to buy them back at much higher rates. This is called a short squeeze and is entirely the fault of shorters overtrading.

Reddit's involvement is more coincidental. There's a guy called deepfuckingvalue (also has a yt channel called roaring kitty) who made a post in July 2019 saying GME is undervalued at $5/ share based on his fundamental analysis and he expects the price to hit maybe $40-50 in the next two years. Mostly he was targetting the console cycle in late 2020 which would increase share price due to cyclic revenue. Most of us downvoted or made fun of his monthly updates from that point. But a few triggers moved in GME's favor.

Michael Burry (The Big Short guy) thought the shares were undervalued too and bought a few %. Ryan Cohen of chewy.com bought 9% shares with an option to buy another 7% and has shown interest in helping it turn around GameStop into a more online business. Four of the existing directors are retiring this year and Cohen would look to replace them with his guys and assume more control over the company.

All of these gradually increased share price and deepfuckingvalue started to make a lot of money. From his initial investment of $50k, he reached $44.8 mil solely from GME shares and options yesterday. This caused a lot of other redditors to buy too and created buzz around it (I got in late Nov, because of the console sales).

Media and redditors themselves have been crediting redditors for this but it's really a combination of positive triggers (large investors coming in, prospect of Cohen led turnaround) and stupid risk management by short sellers which caused this squeeze and got prices to shoot up.</text>

    <text>&gt; They’re not doing well now that most people buy games on digital marketplaces instead of in stores

They have a contract with Microsoft, every Xbox that GameStop sells Microsoft gives them a cut of the digital sales, DLC, and subscriptions. Some money is better than no money. And people are confident because Ryan Cohen and some of his Chewy friends joined the company. Cohen built Chewy from the ground up and sold it for $3.35 billion dollars. People think Cohen can make GameStop do better. They have half the debt they had in 2019, and more cash on hand right now than they have debt.</text>

    <text>The short sellers effectively took out a loan. They went to a person who had, say, 100 shares of a stock. The person who owned the stock, at say $10 a share, gave them $1000, but made them promise that they will pay them back with 100 shares of the stock, not $1000. The short sellers thought the stock would go down so they might only have to pay $500 to buy the correct number of shares.

However, these loans that the short sellers took out have payback dates.</text>

    <text>Nah, it's more complex than that. You sell the stuff but you don't have it, you didn't even borrow it. I sell you 5 apples, but I don't have any in my pockets.
That's the part where the founds fucked up they sold lots and lots of apples they didn't had. Now that their customers are asking for their apples, the founds are realising that they sold more apple than there is available on the market. Mainly because a few people on the internet bought all the available apples they could find and refuse to sell them to anyone.

Naked shorts are selling something even before you borrow it.</text>

    <text>They can, it can just get prohibitively expensive. Let’s say I borrow 1 share from you and sell it for $10 and owe you 1% interest per day. At $10 I can easily pay the ten cents a day until the price goes down. Now let’s say the price hits $1000. Now, at the 1% a day interest rate, I have to pay my initial investment every day. If this investment makes up 1% of my money, I’ll be completely wiped out in a matter of months. And if I can’t pay, my broker will force me to buy.</text>

    <text>Yes. This is what’s called a liquidity issue, when they don’t have assets that are owned my clients ready to returned to those owners. (Flashback to 2008 bank run). That was what’s being called into question today. People were asking if robinhood had a liquidity issue and that’s why they blocked buy and only permitted selling. They needed those shares back.</text>

    <text>As far as I understand it, and very simplified. I'm not expert and you'll probably find a better answer else where but - 

Usually people hope to buy stocks when they are cheap, sell them when they are more expensive = profit. 

'Shorting a stock's means kind of the opposite. Very simplified it means your betting on the stock to fail and drop in price. Hedgefunds (kinda like big pools of investors money) were betting on Gamestop to fail due to covid, digital sales etc. 

Some guy last year bough 53k worth of Gamestop stock and found trends which indicated it wouldn't fail, but actually succeed. He essentially got a bunch of other people to buy these stocks. 

The thing about 'shorting' is that the hedgefunds essentially have promised to buy these stocks back, they are legally bound. They were expecting to buy them back dirt cheap. Not anymore. The biggest point for these hedgefunds is that as long as these redditors and other people hold onto their Gamestop stocks the price is going to continue to rise - this is why you hear people about holding or 💎✋. The longer these 'ordinary' people hold the more these hedgefund millionaires are going to lose. 

Shorting can lead to theoretically infinite losses as you can lose more than your initial investment. Thats why you'll hear people in the media and businesses slamming whats happening, they're getting played at their own game.</text>

    <text>I’m still not clear on how the hedge fund is “manipulating the price”. It seems like they are betting on the price, which is different and their own choice. But I do feel like what Reddit is doing is pooling their money to force the price higher, without any real basis other than knowing it will screw over the hedge funds. I am not a fan of hedge funds but I don’t think Reddit is in the clear on this.</text>

    <text>u/deepfuckingvalue a few months ago came across the fact that the people betting that the stock price of gamestop would continue to go lower while it was already in the single digits had placed so many bets that the number of stock shares being bet to go lower was very high.  The amount of stock shares being bet to go lower was so high, in fact, that it was greater than the total number of shares even available for purchase.  This was shared on the subreddit, wallstreetbets, and many users there saw an opportunity.  They decided to buy the stock and hold them without selling them, meaning the number of shares available for purchase became even lower, which means the price went up as there is less supply and more demand.  The people who bet against the stock did so by, in essence, borrowing the stock for some time with the promise that they'd give it back after selling it.  In order for them to keep good on their promise, they have to buy the stock back, no matter what price it's at.  Because the price went up instead of down further, they lost their bet and are required to buy back the stock at a price which is currently hundreds of dollars when they borrowed it in the single digits, meaning they are losing hundreds of dollars for each share.  There are millions of shares available, but they still bet against more than those millions available, meaning they are losing hundreds of dollars millions of times.  The people that bet against the stock are losing at least hundreds of millions of dollars right now, and it's widely believed that they are going to lose hundreds of billions of dollars before this is all over.  Every Friday, at the close of the market, the contracts which require those who bet against the share to buy them back at the current price expire.</text>

    <text>Okay so my question is pretty simple.

Why are there statements from analysts saying this sets a dangerous prescendent? It seems like the average Joes banded together and did something with collective capital, that individual funds with huge capital do all the time?

They lost out, which I guess would normally be a smaller amount spread out between a lot of average Joe's instead of a huge amount on few funds?

Isn't this only setting a prescendent that stocks are high risk which should have already been known?

I'm trying my best to look at all of this objectively but it really looks like a huge glaring proof of wealth inequality.

I'm super keen to see some point of views from the opposite side of the fence if anyone has it, I.e people who think this is a bad situation etc.

Edit: really appreciate the replys all. What a complex situation... I'm not going to pretend I fully understand what's going on but I'm really enjoying learning all this and better understanding it as I go.</text>

    <text>Yes, if you buy stock all you can lose is your Investment (which can of course still be a considerable amount of money).

What the big investors did was:

They borrow 5 candy bars and sell them for something like $4 a piece (so they got $20 in total).

They were planning to buy 5 candy bars when candy bars cost like $2 a piece (so they would only pay 5x$2 = $10 to buy the candy bars back) and give the candy bars back, so that they don't owe anything anymore.

They would have made a $10 profit due to the difference between gaining $20 while only paying $10.

Their current problem is that candy bars cost considerably more than $4 a piece now. The price for a candy bar isn't capped, it could cost $100 at some point. Buying 5 candy bars for $100 a piece = $500 costs while only gaining $20 at the beginning = $480 lost.

With that type of speculation you can lose an immense amount of money, way more than you initially invested.

So yeah, simply buying stock is fine as long as you can live with the theoretical risk that your entire investment turns into dust.

Gambling with uncapped losses on the other hand can turn into a huge problem.</text>

    <text>Don’t know how true the info is, but some guys on WSB are saying even after today over 120% of the stock is shorted, so the short sellers still have a lot of buying to do to cover their positions, which will drive up the price even more. Some of them genuine believe it’ll go to 1000 or even higher because of this.

I think there’s a good chance they’re right, but I can’t handle the level of stress putting my money in this would bring me, so I’m just watching from the sidelines.</text>

    <text>Fundamentally, no difference. The way you influence a market is with big sums of cash, which is what is usually unique to hedge funds. Investors pooling together is no different to what hedge funds do. They just want to say its different because they are absolutely hemorrhaging cash atm. Its their version of pls stop by referring to this as illegal market manipulation.

    <text>Because in stock market you don't need to own a thing to sell it. You sell a contract that says "I will give you a share for X USD, before Y days". So I use the money you gave me to actually buy the share, and after that I can fulfill the contract. That is a naked shorting.

You can't sell a house or a car you don't have, but you can with shares, it's just speculation.</text>

    <text>If you’re doing regular investing yes. 

Regular investing: you buy one share of Example Co at $5 per share. You now own that share, it is your property. You technically own a tiny piece of Example Co, you’re a tiny tiny investor to them. 

What you are hoping is that in future, Example Co does well. If Example Co goes the way of Amazon, becomes very profitable, then everyone wants to get in on it. That means other people also want to own a piece of the company. 

There’s only so many shares of example co to go around. 

Therefore, more people wanting to buy a share = increased demand for them. That means that the price of a single share goes up, as people are willing to pay more money for it, and it will go to the highest bidder. 

For you, that’s great!! The share you bought at $5 is now something that other people will pay $20 for. If you sell now, you’ll make a profit of $15! 

Do you want to sell now though? Maybe you want to hang on. What if the price of Example Co’s stocks go higher still? You could make more money if you sell at $50 couldn’t you? 

So maybe you wait, watching the price of the stocks go higher. You are gambling that it’s gonna go higher and higher and not drop. 

However, let’s say you wait too long. Something terrible happens. Example Co is a meat supplier, and the entire planet goes vegetarian overnight. Example Co is going to lose lots of money! 

Everyone sells their stocks quickly. There’s a lot of stocks for sale and nobody wants to buy them! That makes the price drop, until people are willing to buy them again! 

Maybe the price of a share drops to only $1. 

If you sell now, you have technically still only lost $4. 

Hope that answers your question.</text>

    <text>There isn't anything wrong with what WSB is doing. Institutional investors do this all the time, George Soros bet against the British pound in the 90's and made billions by exposing a huge vulnerability in how the pound was valued. 

What is unclear as of now is if brokers like Robinhood and the clearing houses that work with those brokers colluded to lock retail investors out of buying more GME in order to protect the short sellers due to corruption or of the clearinghouses themselves decided that they were unwilling to take on the liability of participating in this scheme. In the latter scenario, no one did anything legally wrong except go against the retail investors assumption that the clearinghouses don't have any autonomy in deciding how they want to operate and what trades they are willing to cover.

Essentially, the important distinction is that when institutional investors pull stunts like this, they typically have the ability to follow through without worrying about the intermediaries they work with interfering. Retail investors working on a platform like Robinhood don't have that ability and should not expect to have that ability.</text>

    <text>Fundamentally there isn't much difference. Lots of money can change the way the market reacts. Doesn't matter if the money comes from 1 guy or a million guys. Usually hedge funds try not to put the economy at risk as that might cause issues for them. But sometimes they get too greedy. This time they've gotten too greedy and lots of people caught it and now the hedge funds are throwing a tantrum because they don't get their way like they usually do</text>

    <text>Robinhood restricted buying on the 13 stocks r/wallstreetbets was investing heavily in, and also **sold people's stocks below market value.** It's theorized that this is because of a conflict of interest involving a hedge fund that makes up a decent portion of its business. 

At any rate, this restriction was at such an *unusually convenient* time for the hedge funds to manipulate the market, that people are suing RH, and everyone from AOC to Donald Trump jr. are calling for congressional investigations.

There's a lot more to this that I won't go into here, as per the rules. I really highly recommend taking a look at WSB and trying to see some of the talk about conflicts of interest between regulatory agencies, clearing houses, and brokerages. It's fascinating stuff.</text>

    <text>They can create new shares to sell, but you're right that doing so generally does hurt their stock value in the process. (But sometimes it may be the right move anyway to get that rush of new investment money.)   


In general, the stock value of a company is mostly just a good measurement of how well other people feel the company is doing, and doesn't directly impact the day to day operations.</text>

    <text>Is this the right post to ask for an ELI5 about the mayhem at r/wallstreetbets?

What I think I understand is this: These people are actually playing with real money. They are spending their own hard-earned cash, right?

What I don’t understand and want to is this:  These people saying they’re now sudden millionaires; can they actually stop at any time (notwithstanding addiction to the game) and have real millions in their actual bank accounts?  Or are they paying real money to a broker for a promise that if it doesn’t come true the only person who comes away with any real, spendable profits is the broker?

From what little I understand is happening, it seems like the plot of the Mel Brooks movie “The Producers” where if it all goes to plan, the only people who profit are the producers of the play, not the writers, backers, actors or venue.</text>

    <text>Two ways:

The first is referred to as a “naked” call option. In a naked call option, the broker doesn’t require the stock to be transferred to the option holder.

The second way is if the person who buys the option (and receives the stock) then sells it to a third option buyer (or more). The amount of public shares stays the same, but each share is getting borrowed and sold multiple times by people trading options so the total short interest volume is greater than the number of shares publicly traded.</text>

    <text>1st answer:  Bob owns 100 shares of GME. Jim goes to Bobs broker and asks to borrow the shares to sell short. The broker agrees. Kate buys the shares from Jim. Kate also uses the same brokerage. Jim asks for more shares to sell short. They give him Kates shares (which are really Bobs shares) and he sells them. Pam buys them and she is at a different brokerage. Jim goes to that brokerage too and asks to borrow shares. They give him Pams shares (that are really Kates that are really Bobs). Bam, you have shorted the same shares 3 times.

    <text>They can make more stocks.

If your company was worth a million dollars, and you sold 50% of that in shares in 2015 for half a million, you would have half a million do make the company better.

If you did really well and in 2020 your company is worth 100 million, 50% of that is floating around the stock market. You can then sell off another 10% of your company for $10 million. You've now got 10 million to invest back into your company or give yourself as the owner a massive payout.</text>

    <text>If they buy back shares they sold at a lower price short the money flows. The difference is their loss. And they have to buy it back. You cannot borrow something without returning it. When they buy it back the money flows from the buyer to the seller.</text>

    <text>Say there's 1 share available to trade. I borrow it from you and sell it to Upgrayedd. I owe you one share. We're are 100% float shorted.

Frito then borrows the share from Upgrayedd and sells it to Rita. Frito owes Upgrayedd a share, and I owe you a share. 2 shares owed vs 1 share available = 200% short float. 

That's it in a nutshell.</text>

**Sam** then let's **Rebecca** borrow that same Harry Potter book series and she sells it to **Lucifer**.

&amp;#x200B;

It's the same item, but there are two people who have borrowed it and have to return it to their owners:

* Bob ==&gt; Sarah
* Rebecaa ==&gt; Sam

&amp;#x200B;

For this to be resolved, Bob has to go buy the book from Lucifer and give it back to Sarah. And then Rebecca has to go convince Sarah to sell her the book so that she can return it to Sam.

&amp;#x200B;

You can see how bad a short squeeze might be in this scenario.</text>

    <text>When they short the stick they only “borrow” it from the initial holder and sell that borrowed stock to gain the capital they hope to keep when the stock goes down and they then pay for the original “borrowed” stock. The whole concept is insane to me because it invents borrowing an intangible object in order to create a situation where shorting is even possible. 
To answer your question there effectively is no regulation that bars a hedge fund from borrowing and selling more stock than exists. It’s an incredible risky move that should be allowed to happen for precisely the reason we are seeing.</text>

    <text>The longer everyone holds, the higher the price will be driven (supply vs demand), because the demand will rise to infinity.

If you decide to sell all your shares at say $5,000/share, then that’s where Marvin will buy at, thus driving the demand lower because then Marvin will have fewer shorts to cover. But if every single person holds on and doesn’t sell, then the price continues to rise, which can make everyone richer.

People will start cashing out at whatever price point they’re comfortable with. It’s a prisoners dilemma in the opposite sense of a normal dilemma (there’s not many downsides to this dilemma), it doesn’t hurt anybody to sell earlier than the next guy, but if everyone holds then the demand will continue to rise and everyone makes more money (except the hedge fund, fuck them)</text>

    <text>So shorting means you borrow my stock, sell it and then buy it back later and return it to me, if the price drops during the process you pocket the difference, if it rises you lose some money.

Now imagine this, you borrow my stock and sell it to some one else, that someone goes ahead and lends the stock, which he now legally and fully owns, to some one else, which sells it, and this can go on and on and on... So what's the result? There was one stock in circulation and it got shorted two or more times, meaning that the short position are 200% or more of the total stock in circulation.

How do you solve the above when it's time to pay the piper? Some poor fella buys the stock and returns it to his lender, then the other guys will have to pay the guy that holds the stock to buy it and return it to their lenders, now the guy holding the stock knows what's going on and will have them pay through the nose for that stock... this is what is going on pretty much.</text>

    <text>Yea, that share would be worth 1M. but it's not a realistic example because of the amount of transactions that happen through the day. 

So the entire stock market operates on a supply and demand model. So WSB are increasing price not by saturating the market with overbids but buying all of the supply. As supply diminishes and demand goes up the price goes up. The thing to remember is a share is an actual tangible thing and there is only a finite amount of them. So they aren't saying no we want to buy the iphone for 1m they are saying we want to buy Iphones and as less and less iphones exist on the market they become more valuable.

A real life example was the X-box release. those were $499 retail so people bought them at $499 and when they went out of stock they sold them on ebay for $800+. think of each x-box as 1 share. The Share is probably actually worth $40 but as supply runs and demand remains high people are willing to pay $310 for it. so now the price is $310.

The difference is microsoft keeps releasing more xbox's at retail price, that doesn't happen with the stock market.</text>

    <text>This is actually benefitting the companies. In AMC’s case, they had a big chunk of debt that automatically vested at the higher price (a common feature for this type of company), which was then swallowed by the market activity. So basically, the combination of a quick rise and actual buying/selling activity at those prices in eliminated all that debt at no cost to the company. It’s not an exaggeration to say the meme-buying saved AMC theatres as they were in pretty dire straits before and are now in a much stronger financial position.

For other companies, like GameStop, it probably isn’t impacting the company much if you assume the price goes back to normal at some point relatively soon. Might give them a bit more flexibility financially and certainly forced them to answer some annoying questions from regulators, but probably surprisingly little long-term impact.</text>

Buying GME based on info you can look up on [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics/)? That's public information.

It's clearly "conspiracy" when it's done by a board of directors, CEO, or managers of hedge funds (100s of people at most). But the 5 million decentralized people on r/WSB? No. Especially when it's a public forum.

Philosophically, there is a point where as more people do something, it's less considered a "conspiracy" and more "democracy", right?</text>

    <text>You actually can see that exact thing today with gme since the trade volume was so low. During the day it was floating around 200 then there was a spike for 430-490. Then it went back down. I think someone issue an order for a buy at 420 and and a bunch of ppl bought at market price which drove it higher for a bit.</text>

    <text>When you short you borrow a stock share from someone and sell it on the open market. Who ever buys that share can in turn lend it to someone else, who can sell it to another person to lend it to someone else etc. (this can technically be the person who lent it in the first place, creating a neat but crazy circle.</text>

    <text>Wsb isn't the one trading with insider info and doing naked short selling. They simply see a stock that they think will go up, and they post about it. No difference than blog articles or investment sites talking about stocks. Before this, a lot of wsb's posts were "loss porn". Meaning people posted how much they lost. It's ultimately a betting subreddit. Hence the bet in wsb.</text>

    <text>A broker is a middleman.  A brokerage is a company of middlemen.

They deal with sending those buy and sell orders to exchanges, they may pay fees to use an exchange, they may receive fees tied to the order volume they send to an exchange, etc.  If you want to short a stock, they get one to lend to you, etc.  

From the point of view of a retail investor, it's like a fancy bank account that lets you buy and sell stock, because the brokerage is handling all the weird shit that has to happen to make stock trading accessible to you.</text>

    <text>Let me preface by saying that I’m not a financial advisor. 

The way you’re thinking of buying and selling stocks will be simple cash transactions. 

Let’s say you want two shares of stock XYZ at $50 per share. 

You add $100 (+ fees, etc) in cash that you already have from a checking account, savings account, etc. to your brokerage account and purchase the two shares. 

At that point, if the stock price were to decrease, you are simply out the difference that you paid and the price that you would sell. I.e. the stock price drops to $25. Your two shares would now be worth $50, meaning you’ve lost $50 out of the $100 that you initially paid for them. 

If, however, the stock increases to say $100 per share, then your two shares are now worth $200, meaning you’ve gained $100 if you choose to sell at that point.

Hope this helped.</text>

    <text>Yes! But the particular method that Melvin Capital was using (shorting) maximizing profits without *really* providing value to the market.

If you go out today and buy a $500 stock in a company, you have directly influenced that company's ability to GROW their company. You have provided something of value that they can act on.

But if you SHORT a company, you are betting that they will fail. You are (ultimately) REMOVING value from the company (if successful). The only actor that GROWS in this situation is the hedge fund.</text>

    <text>If for no other reason than their marketing is obnoxious.

But otherwise, the entire principal of etoro is that you copy the investments of other people. You're not going to learn how to invest by copying someone else without explanation.

If your reason to invest is to earn a bit of extra money, etoro are (or used to be) quite open about the fact that most of their users make a loss.

If the only thing you want to do is make more money with your existing money, using very low effort means, you'd be much better off hiring a financial advisor.

I have my savings invested in a stocks and shares ISA. I don't touch it and I don't think about it. If I leave it in there for a couple of years it should average 7% a year. It has its risks, but it's far less risky than etoro.</text>

    <text>Only certain platforms have stopped retail investors (average people) from buying. Some of these platforms, like Robinhood (an app), are financially connected to some of the hedge funds that are losing a lot of money.

The hedge funds want people to sell their stock in GME, and to not buy any more. So, Robinhood (and other apps/websites) are locking users out of buying more GME. But, the hedge funds are still allowed to buy it.

It's illegal, btw - it's market manipulation.

Other platforms (Fidelity, Vanguard, Webull, many others) are still allowing people to buy GME.</text>

    <text>There are several ways to owe more than you have, but you have to WORK to do those -- just buying stocks with your own money, you should be fine. 

It should be pretty obvious if you're doing something that risks more than you have.  for instance:  

Buying stocks with other peoples money (margin accounts)  

Selling stocks you don't own (shorting)  

Selling options</text>

They also increase personal wealth of individual investors. Literally how people are able to be retired and not live off the government.

It also raises tax for the government through capital gains.

It also boosts the overall standard of living in a nation.

    <text>1 - If the company goes into bankruptcy, it depends on the type of bankruptcy.  Sometimes a portion of existing stocks or bonds are voided, sometimes the company itself is liquidated to pay back what it can to existing creditors in order of credit seniority.  If you're a retail investor, you will likely get nothing.

2 - Yes, with only 1 or 2 exceptions, any ticker ending in a Q is a company in bankruptcy.  They often continue to trade.

3 - One of the steps in winding down a company is voiding all stock.  If the company is gone, the stock is gone.</text>

    <text>That’s a great question. At the crux of any market is what each investor is the price any investor is willing to buy at or sell at. Each investor needs to decide how much holding this stock is worth to them. Those telling people to hold are hoping that today the price will shoot up, so they are holding it and hoping others do too. However if you have a gain of $85k and you’re happy with that then you should sell. The problem with that is that as more people sell, the price goes down which hurts the “hold” people.

These types of scenarios (short squeezes) happen in markets but this is the first time that it has happened via social media orchestrating a group of people to pile onto the trade. It will be interesting to see if they can hold the line or if people who bought the stock are willing to hold at such inflated prices. 

To your last question, yes there probably are a few hundred people who made $100k or more. However, there are likely hundreds of thousands of people who will lose money as well. The real price of the stock is somewhere between $0 and $100. Those buying it at $300 are going to have to sell at some point and if when it tanks, someone is going to be left paying for it. A lot of people who got in early made money, those entering late will lose.</text>

2) same as 1, but yeah it is theoretically possible

3) It can be delisted to something called "Pink sheets" if the stock price goes below a certain amount. If they decide to close up shop forever, then the stock won't exist, and it'll go to zero since no one will want to own shares of a non-existant company</text>

At 85k. But the stock is expected to go to at least 1000$ once the hedge fund managers have to buy the shares back (because the have to buy millions of shares which of corse brings the price up )
So what people are saying is to hold so that the hedgefund manager have to cry AND you make more.
85k at 300$ could be 300k or even more what is insane. (But you could of corse also miss the right selling time and make a loss)</text>

    <text>Holding the stock means that the hedge funds in a short position have to pay higher prices for the shares they need to cover their position. If you continue to buy and hold, you drive the price up. So your 85k could turn into several hundred thousand or a million.</text>

    <text>They can try to do that, but if we they wait the prices go higher and the higher the loss for them. But if people hold and don’t sell and don’t buy then price remains stable, in a stable price the hedge funds have a loss as they have borrowed stock now when you borrow something you need to return and rn there is no stock to return. So unless the price dips a lot, it is a loss for the hedge funds.</text>

    <text>So they can sell their stock, but it would be at an ENORMOUS LOSS. Imagine if they only bought 100 Gamestop shares at $15 a piece (thus getting + $1500). 

&amp;#x200B;

If they were to close their position now, they would need to buy the same 100 Gamesotp shares at $193 a piece (thus losing -$193,000). 

&amp;#x200B;

And the motherfudgers seem to have spent hundreds of millions of dollars shorting. You can imagine how much they stand to lose.</text>

This is literally a game of chicken. We’re grabbing them by the balls because of how much money they’re going to lose. The stock is fluctuating to scare people into selling. WEre buying and not selling no matter what the conditions are until we hit a certain number. (I lost 5k then doubled down and bought 5k more in GME . ) 

This was for money now it’s personal. If you plan to make a quick flip, keep your money and dignity and leave this alone and cheer on from the sidelines.</text>

    <text>The short positions which the hedge funds are using all have an expiry date. They can not keep their positions forever. This is why all over r/wallstreetbets you see people urging each other to 'HOLD'. The closer these short positions get to their expiry, the more the hedge funds are forced to close them (as in buying the stock to cover the short positions). This will result in a so-called short squeeze because huge amounts of shares have to be bought in order to cover for the short positions.</text>

    <text>It's the broker's decision.  It even said so in the announcement on the app.  Here's a quote from the announcement that they released:

"We continuously monitor the markets and make changes where necessary.  In light of recent volatility, we restricted transactions for certain securities to position closing only.  We also raised margin requirements for certain securities."

Robinhood is a Market Maker.  It's in their best interest to halt trading on certain symbols to prevent the company that owns them from losing billions.  I forsee quite a few folks jumping ship after this and finding a new broker.  I'm fairly new to stocks and I've had a RH account for a little over a year, and I feel that the bigger crime here is how the brokers halted trading.

I'm not versed in any legal matters about this, but holy crap it stinks...</text>

    <text>Could it? I don't really know the answer to that. Mathematically, I can see a LOT of reason why not to.

If a company just "made" more stock, they would be devaluing their own shares, which would make investors REALLY PISSED OFF. It would likely create a sell-off and a crash of the market price for the shares. I'm not an economist... I'm just following logic.</text>

They can ride it out for a while but if the stock price keeps going up their broker will require them to put up more and more collateral otherwise they will force them to return the shorted stock.

Also they pay (very high) interest rates on shorted stock if you're talking about GME specifically so at some point they may want to cut their losses.</text>

    <text>Yes, they definitely could (and probably should), but if they did that, they'd be selling investors stock that they know is overpriced, and that's the kind of thing that often comes back to bite companies. The SEC may also block Gamestop from doing so, as it could destabilize the market. Also, they can't just do it whenever they want, it requires a lot of paperwork, and could take a week.

Regarding your other question, lots of stocks pay dividends. Companies can either reinvest their profits in growing the business, or they can distribute the earning to their shareholders. Companies with dividends pay each of their shareholders an even piece of the profits each quarter.</text>

He also thinks that people should not make large gains because that would not be in the best interest of the markets.  


HEDGECUNTS knew that shorting a stock can result in infinite losses. And that's exactly whats happening.  


The market cap of GME is not that huge to throw the clearing house to a frenzy. That's a big fat lie. They didn't want their hedgecunt friends to lose more money. So they cut off buying for the retail traders.</text>

    <text>&gt;So would the hedge funds’ overall morality be related more to their historical practices, rather than their more recent short-selling of GameStop? Or was the short-selling immoral in a way too?

Now morality is different for a lot of people. Me personally, I don't think it was too immoral to short sell Gamestop. They are a shitty company who short change people selling video games.

But hedge funds are a special kind of evil and are well hated for their history and their propensity for evil. If they can fuck up something, they will without blinking.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;WSB’s market collusion could be argued to be immoral

As I said before, morality and legality are two different things. It was legal for someone like Trump to pardon Steve Bannon and for Bill Clinton to pardon his brother; doesn't mean it's moral.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;, but if it’s against people who have been doing immoral things to everyone for their own benefit for years, it would be hypocritical to get pissy about one and not the othe

I don't understand what you mean here. But to take a stab at it; I believe that it isn't immoral to steal from a billionaire thief who sex traffics children.</text>

    <text>Stock is (part) ownership of a company. 

An option is a contract to buy stock at a set price at a set time.   Like if I'm pretty confident that the price will not go down, I could sell you an option to buy my stock at it's current price next week.  I get some cash, and you thinking the price would go up a lot, have a cheap gamble.   

Buying an option doesn't get you the stock. Buying an option gives you the option to buy the stock (at a set price).  If it's not a good price, you don't have to buy the stock.

It's a fancy way to gamble on the stock market.</text>

    <text>No, they’re not borrowing from GameStop, but from other stock market participants. 

Almost all market activity happens on the “secondary market” and does not directly involve the company itself. 

A company will emit its shares in the IPO (initial public offering) and shareholders buy them. This is the primary market.   
After that shareholders trade among each other on the secondary market. The company in question can emit and buy back shares but there is more regulation to it.

As for borrowing, selling and borrowing again. Imagine you borrow a PS5 from Person A, you sell it to Person B with the intention to buy a PS5 later at a cheaper price to give it back, then you borrow it from Person B, and you sell it to Person C, again with the intention to give it back to B once prices drop.   
There are now two people that you owe a PlayStation but there’s only one PlayStation.</text>

    <text>\*Hedgie Strategy Today\*

&amp;#x200B;

First off, I don’t know what I am doing and this is not financial advice.

&amp;#x200B;

This is a really important day.  The hedgies are going to be out for blood and this is what I would I would do if I was on the other side of this trade.

We know from yesterday that the brokerage accounts all feed our information to the hedge funds.  They know where our autocalling positions are, how much we are driving the price up with our buys now that we can and have placed long positions before the market open.

&amp;#x200B;

We also know that they were able to buy at the bottom of the market yesterday and some of us even had positions close at this point without our consent.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, we know that Steve Cohen was forced to shut down SAC Capital due to insider trading allegations in 2014 and they have given the hedge funds $2 billion which they would’ve used to take a long position at the market bottom yesterday to help cover their short position.  They have insider information on all of our positions.  They know the battle ground and will be planning accordingly.

&amp;#x200B;

If I was a hedgie, I would also drive the market up when it opens, taking profit as I go.  I would then get to a point where we have set off a lot of auto calls and I would sell out of my long position.  This would drive the market down and I would then sell out of my short position.  

&amp;#x200B;

Since we have been given the ability to jump back in, we're all charging into the market now that we can buy again. As we know from what we've found out today, Robinhood along with the other brokerage accounts give the hedge funds information on our positions, autocalls, and all investments we make. I think what might happen is we're gonna drive the market up when it opens, and as the hedge funds know this they will buy long positions and also drive the price up. The point of this is to hit our autocall positions so that we sell out. Just as we hit our autocalls, the hedge funds will sell their long positions and create a massive sell off between our autocalls and their sell offs. This will drive the price down to a point where they can sell their short positions which are calling today. We therefore need to remove our autocalls so as to continue to drive the price up. Continue to sustainably buy throughout the day so that they can't take advantage of any dips to close their short calls. They fucked us yesterday and created a dip so they could buy long positions. They bought this dip and drove the price up to 230. They have a lot of firepower to be able to do this from Point72 and Citadel.

&amp;#x200B;

Tldr: Remove your autocalls and continue to buy sustainably throughout the day and we'll all be eating meat in Valhalla by evening. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is not financial advice and I do not know what the fuck I'm talking about. Do whatever the fuck you want.</text>

    <text>Buying a stock is a concrete share of the company.

Buying an option is buying a contract that gives you the *option* of buying a stock at a specified price and date.

If I buy a stock of AAPL, I buy 1 share for $137.

If I buy an option for AAPL, I pay X$ (the fee) for the options contract to buy AAPL at Y$ at Z date. So I could buy an options contract for $3.35 (x100 so $335 because options only allow you to buy shares in bulk) that expires on 2/5 which gives me the option to buy 100 AAPL shares at $138. If AAPL magically skyrockets to $200 a share on 2/5, it doesn’t matter. I can choose to buy those shares and pocket the difference (in this case, $62 x100 - $335 contact fee). However, if AAPL tanks to $100 on 2/5 my options contract is worthless (because I won’t exercise the option to buy it at $138 if it’s at $100).

You can choose to buy and sell contracts before the expire because the contract itself has speculative value (if on 2/4 AAPL is at $200 and I own the contract, i can sell it for a hefty profit because it’s very likely to return money by the time the option expires).

Make sense?</text>

    <text>Imagine you’re a kid, and some guy from school who lives down the street has a lemonade stand.  He is offering “stock” that you can buy for $1 to help him buy supplies, with the promise that as he gets more successful, that “stock” will become worth more than $1. You’ll own a stake in that company, so as he sells more lemonade he makes more money and your stock value goes up so you make money too!

But you’re a spoiled, piece of shit little kid who thinks lemonade guy is going to spend all his money on lemons and never actually sell any lemonade. So you decide to “short” or bet against him. Here’s what you do:

You talk to your bigger, shittier brother and say “I want to buy this stock but don’t have the money. Can you help me?” And he says, “yeah, I’ll give you $10 for stock, but I’m going to own the stock until you pay me what it’s worth. And I want it by next week.” So your brother buys you 10 stocks at $1, but your brother is just loaning them to you so you really don’t own anything except that $10 debt. Now thinking you’re clever, you sell that stock he loaned you at $1 each to 10 of your poor friends who don’t get allowance. You do this because you think the lemonade kid is going to fail. And when he stops selling as much lemonade, the value of the stock goes down. And so you reason that when this happens, you’ll be able to buy back the stock you sold those idiots for 10c each. Meaning they each lose 90c and you make $9 off of them. Then you’ll have 10 stocks to give back to your brother, and you’ve made $9 off these idiots! 

Here’s the problem: your friends aren’t stupid, and they are tired of your shit. So they refuse to sell you the stock back at 10c. And worse, they tell all the kids at school what’s happening, and all of them start buying and holding lemonade stock because they see the value going up and want to make money too! So now the stocks cost $2 each, and you’re fucked. And it just keeps growing. As more kids buy and hold stock, you can’t buy what you need to return to your brother, who starts threatening to take your toys if you don’t get him the cash. 

Now from your perspective, you’re the victim here. All these people are ganging up on you! But in reality, you’re a spoiled, rich little shit who got yourself into this mess by literally betting that this kid with a business loses everything. And you know that the more people who buy and hold, the price goes up and up and soon you’re going to be FORCED to buy stock to pay your brother back that value even if you have to pay $10 per share, leaving you with a $90 loss. 

So what do you do? You talk to your mom, who talks to the other moms (brokers like Robinhood) who forbid all their kids to do anything but sell the stock they have. It’s not a free market anymore. The poor kids are being prevented from buying what they think has value, because your bitch ass went crying to mommy. So now the kids are DOUBLE pissed, because all they really wanted to make a little money too, and they REALLY refuse to sell. So with nobody selling their shares, and everyone trying to buy, the price keeps going up. And pretty soon, you could owe your brother $90...$900....$9000...whatever the price ends up. Because you HAVE to get that stock for your brother (cover) no matter what it costs, or he’s going to take an equivalent amount of your stuff as repayment. 

Now the moms say they won’t let the kids buy more because they’re protecting them. “If they buy while the price is high, they’ll lose a lot of money because no lemonade stand is worth this much and the price will drop back to nothing!” But in reality, they’re doing it because your mom has power and influence and they care more about their own interests than they do about their kids making a couple bucks. But the kids don’t understand why they can’t spend their money on the same thing your spoiled ass can. So now they’re furious, because you’re living by a different set of rules than them. 

And that’s basically it. Obviously there’s a lot more complication, but at the core that describes it ok I think. 

Please someone correct me if I’m wrong, I’m actually brain damaged and this isn’t financial advice in any way. All I know is I like GME and I like Dogecoin 🚀🚀🚀🚀</text>

    <text>When buying an option you are buying the right, but not obligation, to 100 shares of the underlying stock. A call option is bullish and means you think the stock price will rise. A put option is bearish and means you think the stock price will fall. There are more advanced trades you can make using options such as spreads where you can combine the two but I won't get into all of that.

An option is basically a way to access 100 shares of the underlying stock at a cheaper price. The option premium will be much less than if you were to purchase 100 shares. The risk of options is that if the stock price remains unchanged or goes the opposite direction of your bet, you will lose the entire premium you pay for that option.</text>

    <text>They have been pushing TSLA for a couple months before this thing really took off. Lots of redditors made good money on buying shares and calls with that one back in Nov/Dec.  I think the key with GME is that the stock was undervalued. This meant that there was a low initial cost of entry.</text>

    <text>That is a heavy question. Trading stocks is the traditional buying and selling shares in a company. To understand options I suggest reading up on Investopedia or something.

    <text>From what I understand, the result of a big short sell against a company hurts the company in the long run due to financing companies having less confidence in them. 

The part that makes this unfair is that you as an average person can't short sell. You basically need to be very rich to do this. 

Hedge funds asks to borrow 1,000 stocks from a brokerage and will pay them 10% interest per day.  The hedge funds obtain the borrowed stock and immediately sell it for $1 each and start paying the interest to the brokerage who owns the stock. The hedge funds are betting that the stock price will tank to 10¢ so that they can buy it back, and give it back to to brokerage that they borrowed it from. They then profit 90¢ per stock. They typically want to buy back as quick as possible to minimize whatever interest they're paying the brokerage. 

If the price of the stock goes up rather than down, the hedge fund has to decide to continue paying the interest, or cut their losses and buy the stock back at the new inflated price. If the price goes up to $2, then they lost $2 per stock, plus the interest that they're paying. The problem is that if there is no stock to buy back (short squeeze) then the price goes up since the demand of the hedge fund to buy it goes up because they need to cut their losses.

This may be over simplified and not 100% correct, but this seems to be the basics of the situation.

Companies like robinhood are siding with the brokerage and deciding that they don't want the brokerage to lose any more money, which is complete manipulation.

Edits: also, I believe if short selling is done in large enough volumes (like these big hedge funds do) it can drive the stock prices of the company they're betting against to go down</text>

    <text>Stock share is a basic financial instrument - you buy it and you own a part of company: you can vote, you can receive part of company income etc.

Futures and options are derivatives.

Futures OBLIGATES you to buy/sell a basic financial instrument in specified time in the future at specified price.

Option GIVES YOU RIGHT to buy/sell a basic financial instrument in specified time in the future at specified price.

In most cases at expiration day you don't get basic instrument but receive profit loss for selling/buying it at market price.

An example:

Today is 29th of Jan, there is ABC ticker that cost $10. For $0.01 you can buy CALL option than gives your right to buy ABC share on 15 Jul 2021 at price $20. You do believe ABC stocks are massively undervalued and buy 10 options for $0.1. ON 15 Jul your options expire and you see that you was right: ABC costs $55 per share so you buy 10 shares @ $20 and immediately sell them @ $55 having $350 total profit. If shares cost less than $20 - you get nothing and lose your $0.1.

NB: prices, dates and ABC ticker aren't real in this case.</text>

    <text>Alright. Short selling is immoral because say a hedge fund sells all their stocks. Everyone around sees the market dipping because a shit ton of stocks are being sold, so they all sell their stocks as well, creating a domino effect. When people sell their stocks, more and more people sell as a consequence. 

Now, even though the company’s performance hasn’t changed at all, the stocks are lower. The hedge fund then buys a shit ton of stocks back at a lower price than they originally were worth (and are truly worth) because of this. Rinse and repeat, over and over, till the price of the stock is completely evaporated artificially. And they make a profit from making the stock prices go down</text>

    <text>They halted buying for retail investors while still allowing Wall Street to keep trading. This allowed hedge funds to drive the price down sharply. The felt overextended, and rather than let hedge funds continue to lose their asses they tried to pull the plug. Hedge funds are still down billions at this point, and rather than take their losses they’re manipulating the market to get the stock price where they want it to be. In a casino, when the gambler wins, the house doesn’t just get to pick up the chips and go home. Not to mention the main hedge fund here, Citadel, runs something like 40% of its liquidity through Robin hood. The hypocrisy is disgusting, and very likely illegal af. Hedge funds have been treating the stock market as their own personal casino for decades.</text>

    <text>When you buy stock in a company, you own a little part of that company.

An option is a type of contract that allows one person to buy a stock from (or sell a stock to) another person at some point.
For instance I could agree to give you the option to buy a single stock in Apple from me tomorrow at $140. For that you would pay me a little money up front. If the stock was worth more than $140 tomorrow, you could buy it from me for that amount and make an instant profit by reselling it. That kind of deal is named a call, whereas a deal to have the option to sell a stock for a price at a time is called a put. 

By the way - options can be on nearly anything , not just stocks. We might as well agree on the option to sell me a ton of grain or a tanker full of oil.</text>

    <text>So buying a stock, you own a (small) piece of the company more or less forever. Say you buy one share of Tesla and it's yours until you sell or it goes to 0. All the gains (and losses) are yours. 

An option gives you the opportunity (but not obligation) to buy 100 shares of Tesla for a specific price (say 950$) at a time in the future (say, Sept 17, 2021). You'll pay a premium for this future opportunity, based on numbers called the greeks but we can leave those out for now. For this opportunity, you'll pay ~177 per share (*100 shares), so about 17k. You're basically saying to another trader "I bet you Tesla will be above 900 by November" and they say I'll take that bet, but the ante is 17k for 100 shares. You say I'm in, and off you go, now if Tesla closes below 900 on the settlement date (Sept 17) you lose it all. If it closes above, you can make money, but perhaps it as much as your 17k premium. (You'd want shares to be approx 1077 or more to make this worth it). This is a call option. Basically a bet the stock goes up. 

A put option works the same, but it's a bet the stock will go down. So keeping everything the same there, but you think tsla will be 650 on the settlement date.</text>

    <text>Stocks do not have an expiration date so you could hold them forever (until you make profit). Options (= contract of 100 shares), on the other hand, are more volatile since they have a set date by which they expire. Since options expire at a certain point in time, the trading risk/rewards are higher with options.

Ex - if you bought 100 stock for $10 each and the stock price increases by $10, you make $1000 profit if you sell.

However, if you bought 1 CALL option (predicting that stock price will increase) for $25 and stock price increases by $10, the option price could increase by $50 which lets you make a lot more profit on a lot less invested money. 

This is of course a very easy version of a lot of concepts involved in options (CALL, PUT, Greeks, etc.)</text>

    <text>An option is a contract that gives you the option to buy or sell 100 shares of a stock at a given price on a given date. You can literally create them out of thin air and sell them to people, but then you're on the hook if the other person exercises their option.

These types of things you can create that are kinda derived from the stock are called derivatives.</text>

    <text>They didnt stop trades. They stopped buys. So a whole segment of the market was no longer able to buy stocks of several companies. Obviously leading to an oversupply and subsequent price drop.
If they had halted any trading on it at all, then that would be another story. Ideally the new york stock exchange would have been asked by a group of brokers to fully halt trading on those stocks which were in danger of eating up all liquidity in the clearing houses.
That wouldnt have just made the shorts a tonne of money at the expense of primarily retail traders.</text>

    <text>A stock is a share of ownership in a company.

An option is a contract to buy or sell 100 stocks at a set price by a certain date. When you are writing an option, you are giving the buyer the "option" to exercise that contract at any time before the expiration date. Options have a lot of complex pricing factors that depend on the expiration date, the price of the underlying stock, and certain market events like earnings reports.

As an option ages, its value decreases, but fluctuations value of the underlying stock can cause an option to go up or down in value too. If you buy a put option with the intent of trading, you want the underlying stock value to go down. If you buy a call option, you want the underlying to go up. This is because a put is an option to sell 100 shares to the person who issued it, and a call is an option to buy 100 shares from the person who issued it.

I hope this helps a little.</text>

    <text>Brokerage charges incur which makes it lucrative for your broker like Robinhood.

And for the person borrowing, he need not pay the full amount.

For eg-
If i want to buy and hold a share worth $100 dollar/share. 
You need to have $100 dollars.
But if i borrow, (please remember if you are borrowing it is implied that you will have to return as well... Mandatory thing), my broker can lend it to me with much less capital say $10 / share.

This segment is refered as intra-day (atleast in my country) and brokerage rates are different from the normal ones. Usually higher than the normal buy/sell. 

I cant say about US.
In my country, this borrowing (atleast for retail investors) is called intra-day. Meaning if you borrow shares and trade you need to close your position mandatorily on the same day before market close.


Tl/dr broker earns commission/brokerage. And for you, you need to shell out less money.</text>

    <text>Stocks give you ownership in the company. You can usually buy or sell at any time (and try to get the best price) or you can hang onto them for as long as you want to be invested in the company.

Options are contracts to buy or sell at particular prices by/on certain dates.

So if I buy an option I'm buying the right to buy x stock at x amount by x date. Its essentially gambling that a stock is going to be worth x by x date and that you'll make a profit by buying or selling.</text>

    <text>I really don't understand this. I keep reading that if people hold GME, then the stock price would go very high like $5k or more due to short squeeze. I feel like at that point, wouldn't the hedge fund just declare bankruptcy instead of paying such high prices to cover their shorts? At that time, won't the folks holding the stock, end up having to sell it for less since regular folks won't be able to pay such high prices to buy the stock?</text>

    <text>Your first question:
&gt;Once you pay someone for them why aren't they your stocks? Why wouldn't they be transferred?
Because its not the initial agreement.. the agreement is to loan the stocks, not sell them. Also, When you successfully short a stock, you essentially make free money. 

If Broker A borrows 10 stocks from Broker B, but then immediately sells those 10 borrowed stocks valued @ $10 p/share (for example), then Broker A has made $100.

The premise relies that Broker A is banking on the stock dropping below whatever price they paid for it.

So if/when the stock price goes down to say, $1 p/share and Broker A now has to pay Broker B back, instead of paying the initial price of $10 P/share, broker A now only has to pay $1 p/share for the 10 borrowed stocks from broker B because that's what thr market values it at.
So Broker A has made $90

Second question:
&gt;Also if there aren't enough stocks since this is all made up stuff in the first place why doesn't the company make more stocks?
I'm kinda winging it with this one, so please don't quote me 100%.
AFAIK, companies are limited to how many stocks they can release at a given time, which is what gives it its value.
If there's only 50,000 stocks available on the market and Reddit wants to buy ALL of them, but the Hedgefunds also need to buy some, this creates demand, value goes higher (or lower based on the scenario).</text>

    <text>&gt;  But if I want out (and the value is unchanged), I can sell my share back to the company and get the $10 back? Or do I have to find someone who wants to buy my $10 share?

You can sell it to anyone who wants to buy it for whatever value you agree upon, however you do have to find a buyer. 

this works by having 2 lists, one list of people who have stock and the price they are willing to sell for, and one list of people who want to buy and the price they will buy for, when a match is found the trade is made. the company, as with anyone else may place themselves on both lists.

i.e. I have x shares, I will sell them for $100, however if anyone else has shares I will buy them at $50.

the stock price you see is just the price the last trade was made at rather than a fixed price on what it actually costs.</text>

    <text>Short seller: I want to borrow you hammer. I just need it for 3 days and I'll give you a hammer back. 
Owner of stock: Great but I also want a box of chocolates (as interest)
Short seller: Deal.

The sort seller doesn't pay the owner the full amount, they just rent the stock. They sell it and then buy a stock back in a few days to give back to the original owner along with some interest.

GME can make more stocks but there is a whole process to it that must be approved by the SEC so it can't happen overnight.</text>

    <text>&gt;Once you pay someone for them why aren't they your stocks

You don't pay the owner for the shares. You only pay interest for every day that the shares aren't returned. To close the trade, you just return the shares to the owner's account.

&gt;Why would someone want to lend them out? Is it the company lending them?

People who own the shares (in reality their brokers) lend the shares. If you don't plan to sell the shares regardless of the price, it makes sense to lend shares to earn some interest off these idle assets. Company has nothing to do with it, it's entirely up to the owners of those shares.

&gt;Also if there aren't enough stocks since this is all made up stuff in the first place why doesn't the company make more stocks?

There are enough shares to meet company's requirements. It's the ahort sellers who sold more shares than actually exist. There is no reason for the company to issue more shares to bail them out, especially when they were trying to drive down the company's share prices.</text>

    <text>You pay rent for the stocks you lend. Shorting is by many believed to only affect the performance of a stock in the short term so the people lending the stocks out are betting that the stock will, with enough time, make the same gains it otherwise would regardless of the short sellers. So their lended out stocks will net them extra profits.</text>

There may be stricter regulation on short selling.  It will almost surely continue to exist though.

    <text>So, first things first - it’s generally not individual people that are lending the stock.  It’s institutions.  And, as has been made clear - they’ll “lend” more stock than actually exists.  So technically, you could own GME stock through some broker and that broker will lend out your stock and make interest on it and you will hav no idea.  Which, by the way is what banks do with your cash - except your cash usually insured by the federal government and there are a lot more restrictions on what the bank can do with your cash so they don’t lose it.</text>

    <text>The only change would be that hedge funds would factor in investors targeting thier shorts.   They make plenty money without shorting so they might just avoid the practice compleatly. 

That said the inverse would also be true,  if they over leverage on vulnerable stock the horde could short the shit out of it and tank thier stock.  

Best outcome for everyone is the short becomes illegal,  which it should have always been.</text>

    <text>Based on this, I guess we can apply this logic to gamestop's stocks rising?

If I understand correctly, short sellers who think gamestop is dropping, decide to borrow its shares, but now that its rising, they're making a loss, and have to pay the extra cost of buying the shares back.
Is this right? 

And because hedge funds deal with shorts, does hat mean that hedge funds managers are losing millions due to gamestop's unprecedented surge, am I right?</text>

    <text>They aren't selling back shares. They are *buying* them back. 

The way shorting works is you borrow shares, immediately sell, wait for the price to go down and hope to buy at a lower price. If it goes up you're screwed for two reasons. First, because now you have to pay more, and second you were paying interest that whole time on something you borrowed.</text>

    <text>Also; how rich do you have to be to even get started?

From what I see on other apps you need a minimum of £200 to even invest(before commissions and fees), and surely that’s not going to net you many shares?

How much disposable income are you going to need to get started? At what amount is it considered low enough for “poor” people to gain access? 


I’m interested since there are memes flying around saying how the “poor” are winning the game, but these people investing don’t seem to be what I’d consider “poor” (I guess it’s relative?) 

Is this Robin Hood app bypassing the usual minimum spends? Am I looking at the wrong type of app/ subject?

    <text>They're kind of just specialized banks.  Or sometimes literal banks.  I have a checking account at the same place as my brokerage account.  

That said, there exist sketchy brokerage firms.  Still, a little bit of research and you can find out your options, how long they've been around, whether they have brick and mortar locations you can go into, etc.  

I don't know all the ways to transfer money to a brokerage account, but for large brokerages, it's going to be way more options than linking a bank account.  That's just the most convenient way.

Savings and checking accounts are generally insured by the federal government (FDIC), brokerage accounts are not.  However, SIPC provides coverage for brokerage accounts up to like half a million dollars... You can check to see if a brokerage is part of SIPC -- it'll say somewhere on their website, with details.

    <text>NO! You havent't missed the squeeze.
Now the stock is traded for around 350€ (~430$) but once the market open, the price will propably rise more. When the squeeze happens, the stock can reach beyond imaginable numbers, it could be 1000$ (conservative), and up to even 3000$ or 5000$, depending on the will of us retail investors, WE set the price, if everyone holds and doesnt sell early.

    <text>This bothers me as well. I imagine it as you lending me your car, which I then sell (even though I don't own it) for $10,000. But you need your car back, so I go and find an exact copy and buy it for $8,000, and I pocket the difference. 

In my example, I'd assume you know I'm selling your car, but if you wanted to sell the damn thing, why wouldn't you set the price and sell it yourself? 

That's the part that I can't quite grasp.</text>

    <text>You missed the chance to make a ton of money unless gamestop explodes up to like $1,000 which is unlikely. It's EXTREMELY risky and I personally would advice against it at this point. I don't fully understand the 2nd question, but people put money into gamestop's stock and since the stock is skyrocketing they're making ridiculous profits off of it. I wouldn't recommend putting your money in any of the stocks, they are all very high risk. Unless of course you already have a ton of money, then knock yourself out</text>

Hedge Funds are big investment firms like Melvin Capital/ Capital LLC, they want to see GameStop become the next blockbuster, us retail investors help avoid that ( and make huge gains, I made a gain of 1000% ).
You can see the amount of shorts still open. And its still over 100 % so the squeeze still hasnt happened.</text>

    <text>1. I don't think paper stock certificates are really a thing any more.

2. I doubt it.  I mean, your bank also loans out the money in your savings account, which is why they pay you interest on it.  That's just kind of how the industry works, as far as I know.

    <text>All companies start out private. Let’s say you start a lemonade stand business. For three years it’s been successful so you want to expand but you don’t have the extra money/capital to. You have two options 1) go to bank and as for a loan in which you are 100% obligated to pay back. 2) take yr company public in which the public gives you money in exchange a piece of ownership(stock/equity). This options gives you the ability to not pay anyone back if yr endeavor fails. Well 3rd option is issuing bonds but that kinda works like option 1. Ok so now you have your extra money and you expanded your stores to 10 stores. After a year you started to make a lot profit. The public who owns those shares can say wow my lemonade company share was worth $5 and now it’s worth $7 dollars. Person A thinks 7 dollars is as highest as it go will sell it to person B who thinks it can go higher. Stocks trading among shareholders/themselves are called secondary market is worth what they think the company is worth to them is called market value. What the company is worth in accounting by doing business is called book value. Book value vs market can be wildly different. Look at Tesla, market value is like 600 bill vs book value of 50 bill. The number 1 goal of a business is to maximize profit thus indirectly maximizing stock value. If a company’s business is doing great the stock will go up and vice versa. Stock prices are a function of a business sentiment ( not 100% true look at GameStop) and management of a company is a affected by stock price. Stock bonuses are sometimes tied to executive pay.</text>

I had no idea Ryan Cohen, former Chewy Founder is now the CEO and wants to turn it into more of an online retailer before all this started happening.</text>

    <text>Because shorting is done on margin, meaning you owe your broker money and must pay interest on the debt while short.... that and the broker can place a margin call on you and even close your position to prevent their loss.</text>

    <text>Yes and no. Yes in that if the company has stock (they do) they can raise new capital by selling. For the companies in question like AMC and GameStop, that can actually be really massive in redoing their failing models and revitalizing the business. Likely, however, the major shareholders will just sell and once the shorts are ended (because no one is shorting these companies anymore) the stock will plummet once again</text>

    <text>I think...you usually have to pay a yearly (?) fee when you short sell.  Since you’re borrowing the stock, the individual or entity you borrow from charged a fee.  In this case, because they shorted it so hard with so many shares, the fee is likely huge.  I could be wrong about this though.</text>

    <text>That's incorrect. GameStop has already issued the stock long ago. The people who hold (and eventually sell) the stock will be the ones making money.

The big benefit to GameStop is that they can issue new shares at the higher price. When they issue shares and sell them into the market, that's when they get $.

Unfortunately for GameStop, a lot of people see this current stock price as a weird fluke, and not representative of its true fair value, so even if they issue stock, they may not be able to get that big payday.</text>

    <text>Melvin Capital can give you a slight idea. It involves a hostile takeover that isn’t hostile, and corrupting the financial institutions. A lot of people’s families would be bankrupt overnight and the only way the government would be able to stop the bleeding is by literally printing money like Germany in 1923. I’m happy and sad at the same time because I lost out on tendies, but my dad isn’t bankrupt due to a financial institution’s miscalculation/bet. You will also notice the media painting Reddit users as evil almost as if they’re going to blame Reddit for a market crash even though hedge funds will be the ones front running it.

Then you take that pen and sell it to someone for 10€, because thats what is worth, with the idea of buying it later at 5€, and profit 5€... What happened this time was that because of a lot of guys on reddit, that same pen now costs 250€. So, for you to give my pen back to me, you will have to buy it back but instead of paying 5 or 10 you will have to pay 250. Multiply this for millions of pens.</text>

    <text>A short is a stock trade deal where you pay a fee to borrow a stock from a trader, with the promise that you’ll return that stock at a later date no matter what. Then you sell the stock, and buy it back later at a lower price and you’re allowed to pocket the difference. So for example, you pay $1 to borrow a share that costs $10 for a week. You sell that share right away, earning $10 minus your $1 fee, so you have a $9 profit. The the stock price drops to $5 due to bad news or whatever. You buy it back and return it to the broker, and you get to pocket the $4 difference as pure profit.  Short sellers do this on the scale of tens of thousands to millions of shares. It’s a bet that you know a certain stock price will fail. Shorting is a risky trade that very often fails, but if it goes right you can make a lot of money for very little initial investment. 

A hedge fund is a type of mutual fund. Mutual funds are companies on Wall Street where people come pool their money together and hand it to a manager to invest, basically saying “here you deal with this for me”. To get invested in a mutual fund you have certain financial requirements you need to fill, you can’t just rock up with $600. A hedge fund is a mutual fund for uber rich people and companies. They have less restrictions and are allowed to take more risks which means they can make a lot more money.</text>

Shorting is basically borrowing a share you dont own so you can sell it with the intention of buying it back at a lower price in the future. You keep the profit and return the share to the owner.</text>

    <text>They bet against $GME stock. There are 2 kinds of bets. Some expire (options contracts), some don't (futures contracts). The one's that expire end typically on Fridays. The one's that don't cost them money for as long as they exist. In order to end the bets that don't expire, they need $GME stock. No one is selling, or at least not selling cheaply, so they either take the upfront loss and buy really expensive stock, or they slowly bleed out money waiting for things to go down.</text>

    <text>That’s not true at all.  Companies have value because they make money.  Companies sell for millions all the time without ever being publicly traded.

    <text>A short is when an investor doesn't own a share of stock but thinks it will fall in price. To take advantage of the expected fall in price they borrow a share of stock from someone else and sell that share at the current (hopefully high) price. When the stock falls they can buy back the share and return it at a lower price (if everything goes well).</text>

    <text>Going short means to borrow stocks and immediately sell them. You anticipate on the stock going down. Later on you buy the stock back at a lower price and give it back, you keep the profits. Problem with going short is that you lose when the stock price goes up. Unlike other tools, going short has no ceiling to losses as stocks can go up to any price.</text>

    <text>Now that you understand a Put Option, a Call Option is the opposite, and it's the second type of Option. Let's say you own a wheelbarrow, and I give you a couple of bucks in exchange for a promise that I can buy that wheelbarrow from you for exactly $20 within the next two weeks. You just sold me a Call Option. Next week, if they're worth $30, I'm totally going to buy it from you. If they're worth $10, I'm not going to buy it, and you'll have earned yourself a couple of bucks.</text>

    <text>Let's say there's a rubber ducky. I borrow it from.you and promise to give it back in a month. Then I sell my interest in the ducky to someone else, and I also lend it to Sal over there. Sal sells his interest in the ducky, and loans it again.

Nothing wrong with that so far. If the duck ends up valueless, as I suspect it will, we'll just unwind all the various transaction.

Let's say that a week in, the rubber ducky lays a golden egg. It doesn't matter how many people have sold their interest in the ducky. What matters is who is holding it at the moment it lays.</text>

    <text>Because they essentially placed a bet that a particular stock would go down in value. As that stock does the opposite and does quite well, it'll never drop to the level that they predicted it would fall below and as such lose that money they bet/invested.

    <text>The number of shares hasn't changed at all. Just who owes who a certain # of shares.

Like say there are 10 Widgets in the world owned by Ogzogz. I borrow all 10 from Ogzogz and promise to return them in the future. I then sell all of them on ebay.

Ogzogz sees them on ebay and buys them. Now Ogzogz has 10 shares, but I owe Ogzogz 10 shares!

Repeat this a few times, and you can owe way more shares than exist, but notice there's never more shares. Just more debts.

That's what they did.</text>

    <text>To add on to your example, an additional problem with what's going on now as I understand it is that 140% of what is actually available (for GME) was promised to be given back at a later date. Like several people collectively accepted money for 14 stocks worth when there are only 10 available, promising to give all 14 back by a particular date.</text>

    <text>Let me preface by saying I am very new to this so take this with a grain of salt.

Yes, it has happened before. With VW in 2008. Porsche ended up bailing out the hedge funds and sold them stock so they could close out their shorts. This time, there is no Porsche.

It is legal. It is happening with Gamestop due to the sheer amount of short positions held on the stock. Over 100% of the total available stock was borrowed. They eventually need to return those stocks, which means they need to buy. If they don't buy, they pay absurd interest rates until they cave.

Another reason is that gamestops total share volume is pretty low so it's not as hard to buy up a huge percentage. The less available, the more pressure it puts on the squeeze.</text>

    <text>No It doesn’t really work that way when you short you are immediately selling, but you aren’t choosing who you are selling to.  The only way to close a short position is to buy.  What you described is an example of a Ponzi scheme</text>

    <text>How do you think we got to 130% shares shorted? If I short a stock, I go to a person with the stock, borrow that share, sell it, pocket the money, plan to buy a share later to give back. These shares don’t have specific markers on them to know the nature of previous sales. They can get passed around indefinitely. Although, I doubt many hedge funds have the desire to short further on GME and the ones in a bind right now won’t have the credit to do it. It’s easier for the funds to buy options or outright shares.</text>

    <text>It's considered a form of fraud. You are not buying the stock because you think it's worth what you're paying, you're colliding with a bunch of people to drive the price up, and ultimately you all plan to dump your shares to suckers who aren't in on the con. 


Imagine you walked into a store where people were buying and selling gems for huge prices, and you decided to buy one. Later you found out everyone else in the store knew each other, and they were just passing gems around between them waiting for a sucker like you to wander in and buy one. You'd be pretty pissed right? It's like that.</text>

    <text>It’s only wrong (illegal) if you’re using false or misleading information to influence others and therefore the price. Classic pump and dump is to buy an undervalued stock, generate some hype so that people start buying, driving the price up and then you “dump” all your shares at a profit. So long as you’re factual it’s legal, but generally considered shady af.</text>

    <text>Pump and dump more involves artificially inflating the market with false or misleading statements and getting a lot of people to buy in so you can dump your shares at an inflated price (which is what makes it illegal). Which is why what is happening currently is not pump and dump. Hedge funds are just sad that normal people are getting rich, not them.</text>

    <text>I’ll explain a pump and dump. So let’s say a large popular company sees a very small company that clearly isn’t going to succeed, and they buy lots of stock in it. Then, they “pump” the value up by cold calling and promoting this worthless stock with false information, causing the value to raise substantially. The company then “dumps” or sells all their shares during this hype, resulting in an unethical profit</text>

    <text>Hedge funds by definition exclude those that don't have serious capital. Somewhere between "second summer home" and "pool on yacht that docks into a bigger yacht".

Retirement funds, while seemingly large, tend to exclude high-risk short term investments in favor of long-term, safe, guaranteed returns. 

Additionally, 401ks are diversified. They'll be made up of thousands of well calculated, evenly distributed investments. The drop in one component is meaningless - you have to eliminate entire industries to really make any change.</text>

    <text>To invest in a hedge fund you have to be what’s called an “accredited” or “sophisticated” investor. In the US, you need to have a solo yearly income of 200k or 300k if you’re married (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accreditedinvestor.asp). This requirement is in place due to the higher risk associated with hedge funds and people that make more are assumed to be able to carry the burden a bit easier if their investments drop. So while not necessarily the 1%, what’s been happening in the market is definitely affecting the wealthy more than anyone else.</text>

    <text>The way I understood it was that GameStop was not doing great, but not terribly enough that they'd declare bankruptcy super soon. But then the hedge fund took advantage of their poorer stock by shorting it, driving its price even lower (I think). So it was a sort of "kick then while they're down" scenario.

That may be wrong, though.</text>

    <text>If you are an average Joe with a 401k and you own etfs with a small cap value bent, congratulations, you probably made ok money this week. As others have said, to invest in hedge funds you need to be a qualified investor. I would be surprised if any 401k/retirement plan that is defined contribution would have a hedge fund option. Now, there are bear etfs that essentially short the market 1-3 times and those can be accessed through brokerage 401k accounts, but I doubt the impact would be as huge as they tend to be very diversified</text>

    <text>This is basically what happened today. The implication is that the retail investors who hold securities are ultimately who the short sellers will have to buy from. This is because there isn’t enough stock available for the hedge funds to reduce the short interest in a significant way. Furthermore, the hedge funds are borrowing these shorted stocks at an extremely high interest rate. So, the longer they hold onto them, the more they pay in interest.</text>

    <text>&gt;Is buying a share kinda like borrowing your money to a company? So if I buy shares for $10, the company can then use those $10? But if I want out (and the value is unchanged), I can sell my share back to the company and get the $10 back? Or do I have to find someone who wants to buy my $10 share

Not really. So a company called XYZ realizes that they need extra cash, so they decide to sell 30% of their company for 10 million dollars. Let's say that they break that up into 30 million shares so each share:

* Costs 30 cents initially
* Lets you own 0.0000003% of the company

This is called the primary listing and is where the company makes its money. After this, any stocks sold/bought are in the secondary market and the company has nothing to do with them. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;What the fuck are bets? Is it just like seeing stock markets as a sports and separately betting on whether it will rise or fall? And why is that relevant to the shares value?

Yup, pretty much. If you bet that the stock of the company will go up, you buy it and make profit. If you bet that the stock of the company will go down, you short it and make profit.</text>

    <text>Understand that these are typically very bad stocks to invest in. The only thing driving up prices was people buying up shares to squeeze the shorts. And if the broker apps are gonna restrict buying like they already are, I’d say stay far far away if you haven’t bought already. Unless you’re willing to lose some money and buy GME!

    <text>Time plays into it because the short positions that the hedge funds took have expiration dates. When they expire, and the stock is worth more instead of less, it's time to pay up.

    <text>Generally, the sellers have very long term faith in the value of the stock and in a sense are betting against the people they’re selling the short to; since they have such a long bet on the stock, loaning it out and getting it back later plus some interest money doesn’t bother them too much, even if the stock decreases in value, because ultimately they believe in the value of the stock long term(post-short) and what they care about most is the ownership of that stock long term.

If the people short the stock but the value of the stock holds or climbs, then they get their interest money plus the more valuable shares back, if the stock rises; which makes it a win-win for the sellers.</text>

    <text>I think you’d benefit from reading up on the efficient market hypothesis and understanding why it’s extremely flawed. 

The two core concepts of the EMH are 1) no free lunch, and 2) the price is always right. 

Right now, there is lots of free lunch to go around for GME holders, and the price in no way reflects the value of the stock (future growth, current equity, etc). 

As others have stated, the true “price” is unobservable and super subjective. We would need to know the future to value a stock perfectly, because stock valuations account for future projected growth. 

We also need to know how all traders think in order to understand the “real” price of a stock. To better understand this, I’d look up second and third order thinking.</text>

&amp;#x200B;

A small dip doesn't phase them as much as it would you or I as they bought many many shares and have confidence it will recover to atleast what they paid. Loaning it out for an interest fee gives them liquid assets to pay day to day bills or to invest in more stocks.</text>

    <text>Joint stock companies began as a way to diversify risk for trading voyages. Say you want to send a ship to India for spices and you're in England in the year 1400. You can spend $1000 to fund the voyage, and make $2000 if it gets back to England. But, if the ship goes down, which happens all the time, you lose all of your money. So, you get nine of your friends to chip in. You each only risk $100, and will get $200. However, this allows you to chip in to many different voyages, since you have $1,000 to spend. If you assume a failure rate of 10% on the voyages, you can turn that $1,000 into $1,800, at a pretty low risk.

This is the basis for what came next - to fund new businesses, people started getting others to give them money now in return for a share of the profits later. This became so common that stock exchanges formed, where people could buy and sell their "shares" of companies. 

What we have today is an extremely convoluted marketplace, with tons of different financial instruments that go up or down in value based on the shares of real companies. This is such a huge industry now that it has created its own, massive industry. But the principle remains the same - stocks exist so that people can start businesses at a lower risk.</text>

    <text>ELI5: It’s like renting a room in your house to someone temporarily, instead of selling that room. 

Stocks still represent ownership in a company, which when holding a lot of this stock gives certain leverage over that company’s decision making. So if someone owns significant control over a company, they may want to make extra money through commission and interest from other investors, without losing control of the company.</text>

    <text>It’s not necessarily all shorting activity. 

The most common time stocks get lent out is around dividend season. A lot of the time there are differing withholding taxes in different countries, so by lending a stock to an investor in a non withholding country the borrower receives a dividend that’s been taxed less and the lender gets a nice fee for doing so, something that brings their total return more in line with a non taxed dividend. 

Likewise, certain securities are required as collateral in certain transactions, there’s a whole number of reasons someone may lend a stock off you outside of shorting. 

Basically, it’s not all short sellers when you’re lending out your securities.</text>

    <text>If you’re in the US, download Fidelity app and transfer funds and buy GME and AMC stock. Ameritrade and Robinhood have restricted buying (which is part of the drama of this whole thing). 

Unfortunately it’ll likely take a few days to transfer funds so you may have missed the boat short term.

But that’s it. Download Fidelity, transfer funds, buy GME, hold.</text>

    <text>Buy and hold GameStop shares. They have to buy back every share that exists, plus another 50%. If you hold a share, they can’t buy it back, which drives the price up. There will always be a demand for GameStop because this fund HAS to buy back all the shares it borrowed. The more people that hold it, the higher it goes.</text>

    <text>Your best bet is to buy Gamestop stock. Of course, this is risky, and it could backfire. But due to the circumstances such as Hedge Funds promising back more shares than actually exist to buy, you could hold onto it and wait for a possible spike in the future, which is what everyone else is waiting on. This could get you insane profit/return. Risky though!</text>

    <text>The hedge funds have only covered a small percentage of the amount shorted.

They are not the only ones who have shorted these companies.

As long as they continue to pay the fees for borrowing the stock that was sold for the short, they do t have to buy the stock to return it. However, the fee to not return the stock increases as the stock price rises.</text>

    <text>The shares which are being trades are borrowed shares. Let's say I have one share. I borrow this from you and sell it to userX. Now someone else borrow the same share from userX and sell it back to you. In theory you should have 2 shares. One that you just purchased and one that you lent me. But I haven't returned you back.

All the long/short positions are done using borrowing the shares rather than actual shares.</text>

If the float is less than 50% of the total issued stock and enough people who are long GME are willing to lend their stock then that could lead to &gt;100% short interest without anything dubious happening.

    <text>Okay so I hope my question won’t get buried, but what I don’t understand is; why now? Why didn’t this happen five years ago already, or maybe even ten years ago? Like, redditors doing this would have been possible for quite some time already, no? 

It feels a bit like the MeToo movement in that there is a structural evil that has always existed of which the public was always kind of aware, but which only happened to get laid bare because of a confluence of events.

And maybe this is naive cos I feel like MeToo also didn’t end up rooting out the actual rotting core of the Hollywood disease (at most it feels like it just skimmed the surface and there were only a few big-name scapegoats), but couldn’t this be the start of a complete takedown of a system that is rigged and unethical as fuck? Could this dent the power and influence of the 1% in any way? Or will this never evolve past a one-off?

    <text>When you short a share you borrow it from someone and sell it. Usually its from a brokerage who has a client with the shares.

Say Bob buys 100 shares of Tesla. Jim wants to short the shares so he goes to Bobs brokerage and they lend him Bobs shares for a fee. Bob has no clue his shares are being used this way. He thinks he has 100 shares. Now imagine Jim sells the shares. Kate buys the shares. Kate and Bob have the same brokerage. Jim asks the brokerage if he can short more shares. The brokerage agrees to loan him Kates shares and he sells those to Pam. This cycle can continue with Jim selling the same shares over and over.</text>

    <text>Message I wrote for a friend explaining the situation:

on reddit, about 2 million people saw an exploit they could use in the stock market, the exploit was this:

as a hedge fund, (businesses with billions of dollars), their job is to short the market, (see if a stock is going to drop, then if they think it will, they bet on it and if it drops they make a ton of money, but if it goes up, they have to pay the dividends.) For example, if Tesla is at $500 per share (stock), they could bet it’s gonna drop to $400. If it does they make money, if not, let’s say it goes up to $600, and they bought 10 shares, they have to pay ~5,000 ish dollars, because they bought ten shares and it went up. Their job is to do the opposite of investors, so they try to bet the market will go down instead of up.

Anyways, people on r/wallstreetbets saw that hedge funds were betting that GME (gamestop) would short, (go down). So, they decided to get all 2 million people on that subreddit to join them in buying GME stocks. The idea is, if you buy a stock, the price goes up super slightly, and if millions of ppl buy a bunch of stocks, the price per stock will skyrocket.

So, WSB (r/wallstreetbets) did exactly this. GME was valued at $27 per share, and hedge funds began to bet that GME would short, so, WSB bough a TON of GME stocks, and forced the stock to skyrocket. GME hit $500 per share last night, meaning that multiple hedge funds had to pay BILLIONS of dollars. 

All of this happening, and people are becoming millionaires everywhere. If you bough ONE share of GME at $27, and sold at the peak, ($500), you would’ve made ~$441 profit, but people bough hundreds of thousands of shares, so they made millions.

This means hedge funds went bankrupt. The rich people lost all their money, and the poor became rich. For the retards on snapchat, this is where the story ends, but there’s a lot more to it. 

Super powerful people saw this, and didn’t like they were losing money, so, they got in bed with brokerages, and made them get rid of the “buy” option for GME and a couple other stocks. Meaning that they took away everyone’s power of their own money, just because they lost some of theirs. GME crashed today, but there was no volume behind it, meaning that nobody sold, so there is no reason it should’ve crashed. This means that somebody powerful manipulated the market and made it crash, which is EXTREMELY illegal. 

So, WSB are the actual good guys here, and the government, along with many billionaires are in deep shit for removing the people’s freedom of finance and manipulation of the market, which basically means they toyed with peoples money.

Edit: I just want to clarify, I am in NO WAY an expert. Some of this may be inaccurate, this is just my take, and how I explained it to someone who didn’t even know what a stock was. Take it with a grain of salt.</text>

Essentially, these people have the option to purchase this stock at an insanely cheap price....the short sellers are also forced to purchase the stock at insanely high prices...the hedge funds sold more than they can cover...and on top of selling more then they can cover, they will be forced to pay insane prices for these stocks....gonna be wild.</text>

    <text>I think you are incorrect about hedge funds only shorting stocks.  They can buy regular stocks and other financial instruments as well as shorts, and "hedge" is not really very accurate to describe them, because they tend to invest in riskier things (like shorts), which is the opposite of "hedging your bets".

You should also mention that these funds shorted more than 100% of the stocks, which put them into this incredibly risky position (which made it easy for WSB to trap them).  I guess this is possible when one person shorts a stock (borrows it from someone and sells it), and then that person who bought the stock borrows it to another person who is shorting the stock.  You only have one real stock, but two people who are owed a stock when all is said and done.</text>

    <text>One question I have that I cannot seem to find an answer to: what is forcing the groups who have short sold to cover their short sells by sometime?  I keep hearing that tomorrow is some sort of deadline. Who set this deadline? Why do they have to buy back their shorts by this deadline, and what happens when they cannot afford to or the stock isn’t available for them to purchase?</text>

    <text>Some recent examples of (probable) illegal market manipulation:

There were rumours that the hedgefunds were shorting GME stock in an effort to tank them. Knowing that a massive hedge is shorting a stock was supposed to intimidate people into selling, thus they profit off of the short.

The affected hedge funds most likely lobbied to trading apps (like Robinhood) to stop allowing retail users to buy GME stock (but still allow you to sell). The goal of this was the try and create a panic sell. Once people start to sell, it will probably create more panic, and it will often lead to the stock tanking again.

Essentially when you have billions of dollars invested, it is pretty easy to intimidate your way into getting the retail consumers to do what you want.</text>

    <text>There’s a few basic ways that aren’t as complex or difficult to understand that I’ll explain.

Price targets: an analyst comes out and says this stock trading at $50 is actually worth $100. people follow the analyst and start buying

Media: Bill Ackman famously going on CNBC and said that the stock market is going to zero while he was buying stocks (forcing the market down to buy low).

Short selling: Through your own selling pressure you can actually suppress the price of a stock depending on the amount of capital as well as the cost of the stock.</text>

    <text>They can't exit, because this isn't just any short position. People found out that GME was shorted 140% times the amount of available shares floating in the market of the company (how this is even legal is beyond sanity). If they tried to close them, the price of GME would go through the stratosphere as they buy back the shares to close the short positions. 

Also greed, they keep holding onto the short positions because when they see it go to $40-60, they thing it's unsustainable (which it is) and that it will go back down to market value, but the army of WSB was determined to keep buying long positions as long as they kept shorting.</text>

    <text>Everyone refers to short stocking as borrowing a share from someone, selling it, waiting for the market price to drop, and buying it back again. So, who exactly are the borrowers and who are the lenders in this situation with GameStop?</text>

    <text>A good example of this is Bill Ackman shorting Herbalife.  He had a huge short position and was very vocal about how terrible the company is.  If the stock goes down, he wins.  Even had a documentary on Netflix about it.  In hindsight, it appears pretty obvious that he was trying to manipulate the stock price to make money.*

    <text>Only those who came in early are going to realistically make out like bandits. Once this story hit the mainstream the buy in price is already too damn high.

This thing is gonna crash soon with those who orchestrated it, and the early adopters, cashing out big and leaving all the fools hopping in now with their life savings flushed down the drain.

    <text>Im not an expert, but they arent actually buying the stock. They are borrowing the stock with the promise of buying it back after some time. So if you think the stock is going down you can borrow some of it with the promise of buying it back later in the hopes that buying the stock back will be cheaper than for how much you sold it.  
However, with the promise of buying the stock back later, there is an infinite possible risk since there is no ceiling to how high the stock price can rise.</text>

    <text>The original shares issued by the company are little piece of ownership in that company. You then sell them to other people that want those shares, not normally back to the company. Platforms therefore facilitate this buying and selling and for common stocks in low quantities it's super easy to sell/buy.</text>

    <text>&gt; think what WSB did was illegal or criminal?

They don't think that.  They are arguing it's illegal because it's contrary to how they nominally behave resulting in them losing a lot of money.  The argument is, in itself, a bullshit argument.

&gt;Why did Robinhood suspend all trading? 

Because they are weasels.  They buckled to pressure placed on them by their largest customer: citidel capital.  Citadel capital is also the parent company of the primary hedge firm who got hit hard by the actions of the retail traders.

Robinhood should not have unilaterally restricted the actions of retail traders and will likely face severe consequences.

&gt; Didn’t WSB play by the rules of the game

Yes.  Nothing the retail traders did was illegal.  It was just not in the best interest of the hedge funds, who are the ones crying foul.</text>

    <text>Because the idea is that the regular people who bought the stock at 20 would want to sell at 40 to double their investment; so once they sell, the price will go down again.  For the regular people who are just buying it; their money is more straightforward with gains and losses.  The Hedge fund is more of a bet or a reservation.  Whatever they bet, or reserved will have to be called in.  So thus they will have to come in and pay that price of where it is even though they reserved it at 20.  So thus effectively screwing them.</text>

    <text>&gt;The only part I’m confused about is why hedge fund bros and actual Wall Street professionals think what WSB did was illegal or criminal?

Well, WSB made them lose a lot of money. Aka, it's a crime for poor people to make rich people slightly poorer

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Why did Robinhood suspend all trading?

First off, to the best of my knowledge they didn't suspend ALL trading. They only suspended buying GME stocks, you could still sell it. 

Now the reason they gave for doing this is "blah, blah, blah" (you can see this [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fs_lyGn4YA&amp;ab_channel=CNN) video if you want to learn more). 

But to many people it looks hella sketch, since one of the investment firms owns a big stake in Robinhood and this move only helped the billionaire firms who wanted the price to drop. Selling a stock decreases its price, buying a stock increases its price. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Didn’t WSB play by the rules of the game, even if they screwed over some power people?

Not really sure what the rules are, so I can't answer this one.</text>

    <text>Tomorrow a bunch of call options expire that will force large funds to sell the stock at insanely low prices the higher the stock price is the more options will be exercised causing more shares to be bought short. 

A lot of different factors but mainly momentum at this point. 

Because they are wall steet and are smarter than the retail investor they can't be wrong. The picked the wrong horse and refuse to admit it and just keep saying double or nothing until the bookie breaks their knees. 

Options give you the right but not the obligation to buy or sell the underlying security x100. So if you buy 1 call option you can buy 100 shares of gme for $12 as long as the stock price is above $12.</text>

    <text>Unfortunately it's kinda late. The folks who got into it when GME was under 20$ are gonna clean up. It helps a little to view it as a pyramid scheme. The guys who got into it early have spent a long time hyping up the stock. They brought others into it with their enthusiasm. The more people joined in, the more momentum got going and the stock price kept rising. I honestly don't know if this could be classed as market manipulation on the little guys part or not. If you really want in, join some stock subs. Try to find a cheap stock that you think will rise and buy into that. At this point GME is an over valued house of cards in my opinion. The instant people start to sell, there will be a wave of devaluation.</text>

    <text>The argument they are making is essentially we are discussing the securities exchange with the INTENT to manipulate the market. This is false. 

Robinhood claims to have stopped trading in the interest of the investor. However, speculation suggests they are in the pockets of people with a lot of money and power who have a lot of money to loose if (when) the infinite short squeeze begins.</text>

    <text>When you buy a stock, you can choose to sell it at any time. When you purchase an option, it always has a expiration date. Options usually expire on Fridays. So, since this really came to a head this week, this Friday is big. 

Hedge funds (or anyone) who is shorting a stock has to pay back that stock on the expiration date. It’s very possible they sold the option when the stock was at $15, expecting it to fall further. Tomorrow they will be forced to buy back the stock at the current price. If they did this with hundreds or thousands of stocks, the losses add up very quickly.</text>

    <text>If they caught on early like AMC did, you can use your high stock price to say "Look at how well my stocks are doing! I still need some money to tide over my shitty situation, so will you let me buy a loan from you for X price? You can see I'm good for it!" And a bank will loan them at a better rate than if they were at near bankruptcy. This loan could extend the life of the company enough for it to fully rebound. Usually companies in this short position are expected to tank heavily, so they're usually on the verge of bankruptcy.</text>

    <text>Yes, they could issue shares in return for capital (money). When GME was priced at $11, issuing 100 shares would net them $1,100. Now at a price of 193.60, it would net them $19,360. This is similar to what Tesla did, recently.</text>

    <text>You should be good to go in the am. You can put in an order now for limit (set your price) or market (buy whatever the price is). You’ll be in a queue and will be fulfilled as soon as a seller is matched to your bid price. A limit order may never be filled if it is lower than the price at opening and stays above your bid.</text>

    <text>Brokers will loan out shares that their users have, often without their consent. I believe generally there are less restrictions on them lending out shares that were purchased on margin, meaning shares purchased by borrowing money from the broker. 

The way to stop this in theory is just to set a high sell order. Brokers cannot loan out shares that have sell orders.</text>

    <text>From my [limited understanding] no, in the long run, it won't go well, because they don't actually have the cash or assets to back that up.  So eventually this will fall.  It's been inflated, overvalued, and the unfortunate truth is that eventually, big stockholders will sell.   Which means that the stock will go down, the only way to actually make money here is to sell, and if everyone holds onto it, only the big companies will make money when they sell it.  Also, someone has to be willing to buy at that price for you to sell as well, so if no one is willing to pay for it, you're stuck with it. 

Please feel free to correct me, I'm not an expert here, but that's my understanding.</text>

    <text>Imagine you have a warehouse of bikes.

Now, I have a buyer that wants to buy a bike for $300, but I think that next week there will be a big discount and I can go buy a new bike for $100. I ask you if I can borrow a bike to sell to the buyer and you agree, so long as I can replace that bike in a week. I sell your bike and wait for the next week. Sure enough, the discount kicks in, I buy a new bike, and give it to you + a small fee for borrowing it. I make money and you have your bike plus the fee. That’s a short-sell.

But what if instead nobody is selling any bikes next week? The price goes WAY up because everybody who short sold NEEDS to buy. That’s a short squeeze.</text>

    <text>The borrowers are anyone who shorted the stock. The lenders are just any shares available. If you own 20 shares in a company for all you know all 20 of them have been sold out from under you, but you still own the stock. If you go to sell your 20 shares, the broker will just borrow someone else's shares to sell for you. It's like how a bank uses your cash for loans and whatnot. You still have the cash, although it may have been loaned out.</text>

    <text>Yes, companies always hold some portion of their own stock as stored capital. What is often the case with these aggressive shorts is that they target an already struggling business, plummet the stock, and when the business wants to make some sort of reformation to improve its business model, it now suddenly no longer has any capital to do so with.</text>

    <text>There is a lot of talk about how the US government will introduce legislation to protect hedge funds from events like this in the future. How could legislation like this be realized? As far as I understand it, nobody did anything illegal or anything that the hedge funds themselves weren't doing already. Would it be possible to lock out "private" traders from the stock market altogether?</text>

    <text>You don’t. You can’t know that. But at this point this isn’t about making money. It’s about fucking them over. Of course if you are really hurting just sell when your profit is deemed enough for you.   

But honestly if you invested like 1000 bucks it’s worth it to maybe loose it f it means something good comes out of this.  

But no one will judge you if you sell.</text>

    <text>After hours trading is a mere indicator of the price, it isn't really price manipulation.

If a small section of the population gets their own hour to trade, all the transactions are just for them within those hours, if price rises or falls, fine, but price will return back to its expected value once trading resumes for everyone.</text>

    <text>It's a combination of supply/demand and company performance.

There are a finite number of shares a company makes available. Shares are literally a share of the company. So buying a share makes you X% owner. A company limits how many shares are available for that reason (they still want to be majority owner of their own company after all). Buying a share lowers the supply, increasing the price. Selling a share increases the supply, decreasing the price.

The companies performance creates the demand. If a company goes bankrupt, all the shares become worthless. The stronger a company does, the safer the shares are.

This is a very basic explanation. There are a lot of other things that can influence a stock's price. Some of it intangible such as a new CEO being hired. Others are very defined such as quarterly revenue. But the very basic explanation is laid out above.</text>

    <text>This relies on:

1) Short selers running out of money and needing to buy back the stock

2) There being a short seller for everyone holding the stock

(1) is questionable. (2) is just false. There are MORE STOCKS THAN SHORTS in circulation. This will always be true. People might tell you that GME has more shorts than existing shares, but that is misleading. If a company has 100 shares, and 120 shorts, that means people own 220 shares total. When a company shorts a stock, they effectively create an extra stock to sell to someone else. So there are 120 short sellers who need to buy, but there are 220 people who need to sell. You're risking selling too late, and not being able to sell at all.</text>

    <text>&gt; but since this isn't really a marketplace where bartering can take place

It is a marketplace. Someone sets an order that they are willing to buy (or sell) a certain quantity of an asset at a *particular price* or better. If another person wants the opposite, a sale is made. If they are far apart and can't agree, then no sale is made.

If you decide to buy "at the market price," you're agreeing to buy whatever is the best price currently offered. That's why people encourage you to set a limit order, to specify the price.

In actuality, you don't buy directly from the other party, but from a market-maker: a titanic company that acts as the middleman and has a giant stock of shares. They make their profit from the small difference in price between buys and sells from investors (the bid-ask spread), not from owning the actual stock.</text>

    <text>Also this is a market in which bartering takes place. You choose what price you offer your share at ie you can sell it at market or take advantage of lack of supply and chuck a 20 dollar (for example) premium on it.</text>

    <text>Here's something that was never 100% clear to me- what's the actual process that takes place when a share is purchased or sold that makes the price go up/down? For example, John owns a single share of Random Company, currently being traded at 100 dollars a share. John decides to cash in and sell his share. He would then approach the stock exchange where the trading takes place (well, his broker in real life, but whatever), and state that he owns a single share of Random Company and would like to sell it for $100.
The end result of that is John gets $100, and the price ticks ever so slightly down. 
My question is concerned with why does it go down, and who/what decides that. The economic mechanism of supply/demand is clear to me, but since this isn't really a marketplace where bartering can take place, it's not like  potential sellers would see that John has just sold his share and would therefore adjust their offered price- it all happens independently from the traders.

So what happens there? Does the stock exchange's algorithm adjust the price because more shares are now available for purchase? Something else?</text>

    <text>No I wouldn’t say anything is guaranteed in the stock market. This situation will eventually bust. The cause and result are up to speculation of course but nothing lasts forever. That breaking point could be tomorrow. Could be the second after you buy in.

What if right after you jump on the band wagon then individual investors start to cave and sell like crazy and the price plummets.

One of the key ideas about the stock market is that you never know where the peak is until it’s already passed therefore you can never “guarantee” you aren’t buying at the peak.

It’s a highly unusual situation and the risks are not easy to calculate but it’s never 0.</text>

    <text>The "price" is usually an average of what is called the bid/ask spread, which is the difference of the lowest someone has currently put out an order to buy ("bid") and the highest someone has committed to sell for ("ask").

In reality theres lots of these always outstanding, and the "price" is basically where they are actually meeting (on average) and actually trading.</text>

    <text>I like to use the car analogy. Lets say you have a car, YOU THINK that car is worth 100 bucks (its an object. make it anything you want. a golden apple. a cat. it doesn't matter.) 

If there's one person out there who wants a car just like yours, and thinks its worth 100 bucks.. he's going to buy it and the price of that car stayed at $100. 

Now imagine you don't really know the value of your car, and you put it on craigslist for $100. Two guys show up almost simultaneously. One guy says "I'll give you 101" so the other guy says "I'll give you $102" and so on and so forth, and you're going to take the highest one, because you don't really care which of these people gets your car.. so the price has risen.

Same scenario. you put your car on craigslist for 100 bucks.. and it doesn't sell. no one shows up. so you change the price to 95, then 90, then 85, and finally someone shows up and pays 85. The price has fallen. 

This is a WAAAAY oversimplified example of how the stock market works. 

FWIW, this can also happen from the buy side. You really want a car, "will anyone sell me a car for 100 bucks?" and you'll raise your amount you're willing to pay until someone sells or you give up.</text>

    <text>They are not buying them, but 'borrowing them'.

For example. You think a stock wotrth 5$ will lose value. You borrow stocks from a willing party for a small fee. This stock you have borrowed, so you are required to give it back at some point. So, you borrow the stock and immediately sell it for 5$ on the market. One month later you hope that the stock has gone down to 4$. Then you buy the stock back for 4$, which you then give back to the party you borrowed it from.

You now have made one dollar profit minus the fee for borrowing the stock.

However if the stock goes from 5$ to 10$, you will have sold for $5, and have to buy back for 10$. Losing 5$ and the fee in the process.</text>

    <text>There is never a “price” as you mentioned in your example, there is only a “bid” (thousands of buyers wanting to outbid each other on buying shares for slightly higher/lower than the previous guy) and an “ask” (thousands of sellers asking for a higher/lower price to sell their shares for over the next guy). This bid/ask spread creates the liquidity that determines whether a stock goes up or down every fraction of every second that it’s being traded. 

When there are more buyers than sellers, the spread gets pushed higher and higher as people are willing to pay more than others to get their shares. When there are more sellers than buyers, the spread gets pushed lower as people lower their ask to try and outsell the other sellers.

When you hear “GameStop closed today at $XX.XX”, it is the estimated value of the midpoint of the very last order’s bid and ask before the market closed.</text>

    <text>The amount of stock available doesnt change unless a company issues new shares. Price changes because of fluctuating supply and demand. If there's 1000 sellers of a share and 1 buyer, the share has to be pretty damn cheap. The inverse is true if there's 1000 buyers and 1 seller, the price is going to increase.</text>

    <text>So if the borrower does not return the stock on time to the lender, because of uptick of the stock and he waits for downturn, he (the borrower) actually loses money (the interest he owes to lender) EVERY day, on top of the possible losses due to the uptick itself. Right?</text>

Or, is it more likely that the SEC just stops trading for a few days to allow them to rethink and in that time they somehow get the price to lower?</text>

    <text>It just takes a lot of factors to all line up. I'll describe it using pens.


You borrow a classmates pen. It costs $1. You give them 5 cents for borrowing it and promise to return it at some point. You go and sell the pen for $1. Next week pens go on sale, you buy one for 50 cents, and return it to your classmate. You've made 45 cents (50 cent profit, minus 5 cent borrow fee). This is a short.


So for a short squeeze to work, a lot of things have to happen. First there has a to be a lot of pens shorted. You'd have to have a situation where out of the 100 pens in the school, you've borrowed lots of them (in this case with GME, you've borrowed 130 pens). Second, you need something to happen to make these pens more valuable all of a sudden. Most people didn't really care about their pens...but all of a sudden an essay writing competition pops up out of the blue and now pens are really important to have. Third, people have to not take easy money on their pens. If you see a couple classmates getting $1.25 for their pens, well hey that's better than $1! I better take that offer, that's better than a dollar! For a squeeze to work, a large portion of the students have to say "You know what, I'll sell you my pen, but it's gonna take wayyyyy more than $1."



Hope that helps.</text>

    <text>Short squeezes require very specific conditions and the deployment of capital. If a hedge fund doesn't go overboard shorting like they did here, it won't be possible to have a short squeeze. Often a short squeeze is caused by someone purposefully screwing the shorts or alternatively by sudden unexpected news. This one is unique because it isn't one entity causing it, its just regular people.


So long story short you need billions of dollars and a dumb hedge fund.</text>

If you have some time to kill, here's an hour long video that the relevant wsb user made back in July regarding his reasons for the position. Just something to keep in mind when someone say this was overnight madness no one could see coming.</text>

    <text>Shorts don't hold. Shorts BORROW from a LENDER (who lends like a bank lends cash but inestead stock, for an APR, in this case a VERY high APR) and sell. The Short BUYs back at the end. The BUY back at the end is the most important part. This means they could have INFINITE losses. It's the most risky play there is. WSB took the inverse (opposite) play, which has limited risk, and wrecked them. It's going to be to the point where WSB can name their price.</text>

    <text>Total noob here:  
What happens if a hedgefund looses this much money? 30B? 70B? Will it not have adverse effects on the rest of the economy / society? Is it not similar to what happened in 2008?

I am personally delighted to see the average people fight back, but what if by doing so, we create a huge vacuum in the economy, and the banks and money-people will be bailed out again, with the rest of the economy collapsing again, resulting in the same crisis we had in 2008?</text>

    <text>In answer to your first question, that more closely resembles a bond. A share is purchasing a very small portion of the ownership of the company, not lending that company money. You generally purchase (and sell) shares from (and to) other shareholders, so the only time a company receives money for its shares are when it initially issued shares, or if it chooses to make a new share offer.

Shares = ownership, bonds = debt</text>

    <text>I’m just a smooth brain from WSB, but I understand gamma squeeze and short squeeze to be very different. In GME’s case, both are happening. 

A gamma squeeze stems from options. Currently you just need to focus on what’s called a “call option”, or “call”. This is a contract made between a seller and a buyer that gives the buyer the right to buy 100 shares of a stock, at any point in time, for a previously agreed upon price - the catch is that the buyer has to pay a fee up front, and the call has an expiration date. 

Let’s say you go to a broker, and ask to buy a GME $400 call option, which expires tomorrow (on Friday). The broker sets a price to buy this option - perhaps it’s $1,000. I pay $1,000 up front and now I’m entered into a contract with the broker. I can buy 100 shares of GME stock at any point until the end of the expiration date (tomorrow) from the broker for the agreed upon price (in this case, $400). 

Now, currently as I write this GME is trading at $311. So if you were to choose to exercise your option right now, and buy 100 GME shares at $400, you’d be ripping yourself off. You already paid the broker $1,000 for the right to enter into this contract, and now you’re buying overpriced shares? That makes no sense!

What does make sense, however, is if the stock exceeds your agreed upon price (this is called the “strike price”). Let’s say GME hits $500 at some point tomorrow. Now it makes sense to exercise your call. You go to the broker, and you buy 100 shares of GME at $400/share, because that was your strike price. Because the current market value of each share is $500, your gain is $100/share! Multiply that by the 100 shares you just bought, and you’ve made $10,000 - $1,000 (the upfront cost to buy the call, also known as your premium). You’ve just made a net total of $9,000 off of your 1/29 GME 400C (that’s the way options are written - the expiration date first, followed by the stock’s ticker abbreviation, and finally followed by the strike price and a “C” to denote that it’s a call option). 

Now, when your call strike price is below market value, meaning that you’ll be making money, that call is considered to be In The Money (abbreviated ITM). If a call is ITM, the broker needs to hold 100 shares of whatever stock that call is for, to be able to sell those shares to the buyer of that call. 

A gamma squeeze is when there are an unexpectedly high number of calls ITM, and the broker needs to buy large amounts of that stock to cover for the unexpected calls that are ITM. Tomorrow, if the price holds the same that it is now, *100% of all calls written for the week and the month will expire ITM*. The brokers are currently NOT PREPARED for that at all. 

In the event that this occurs, brokers will have to buy massive amounts of stock all at once to cover for the unexpectedly high number of ITM calls. In GME’s case, there were over 100,000 calls that were sold and will expire tomorrow, 100% of which will expire ITM. Brokers will be forced to buy potentially millions of shares of GME all at once tomorrow. That will launch the price sky high even without a short squeeze. 

So a gamma squeeze is, in essence, when brokers don’t expect so many calls to expire ITM, and they’re forced to buy large amounts of that stock to cover for their sold ITM calls. This has no bearing on the still upcoming short squeeze, except for the fact that if this happens, the upcoming short squeeze for GME will start sooner.</text>

    <text>No.

The gamma squeeze is a result of the price rising rapidly, which causes options pricing to also rapidly change. The faster the price rises, the more shares a market maker needs to buy to hedge the sales of options. Buying makes the price go up, and this can turn into a feedback loop. This is what's been happening so far.

The short squeeze is the end result, in theory, of a combination of all of us holding shares we buy through all of the gamma squeezes and the dirty tricks used by hedgies and MMs to push the price down.

Then?

ETA: Bid/Ask spreads on today's order books were already blowing WIDE open (thousands wide at some points) before being halted. We were on the brink of the short squeeze today.</text>

B borrowed $1 from A.

C borrowed that $1 from B.

D borrowed that $1 from C.


3 people borrowed it and they owe it back to 3 people, but there's only that $1 that is being borrowed again and again. Replace that dollar with GME stocks and voila.</text>

    <text>Yeah pretty close. Hopefully this isn’t too technical: 

We don’t actually own physical shares, obviously. Just numbers on a screen in an account at a Clearing bank. 

When you put in an order to “sell” a share, you are required to Mark it as either “long” or “short” 

This Mark denotes whether you have the shares in your bank account...

Or

You are *able* to borrow them. Typically it’s not a formal loan, but rather, proof that you can *get* a loan with something called a “locate”</text>

    <text>When you short a stock you borrow shares and sell them, hoping to buy them back at a lower price so you can return them with a profit. This is fine as the borrowing is secured in actual shares. The problem arises when shares are being borrowed several times over, and the short value becomes above actual available shares, then you have naked shorting, where the shares being borrowed is no longer secured in actual existing shares.

This is what happened to GME by greedy hedge funds, and they got caught. Now they are desperately trying to recover by using any dirty trick in the book, changing the rules and playingfield for the retail investors mid game.</text>

    <text>It’s not really a “formal loan”. When we sell short, what we’re dealing doing is saying we don’t have the shares currently, but we can get them (only if they’re “easy to borrow shares”) - this is done through what’s called a “locate”</text>

    <text>&gt; I assume that there is a fee involved, but I can’t make out what would make this worth it.

Yeah this is a major part left out of the explanations as far as I can tell. The original holders that are lending out this stock get an enormous amount of fees paid to them, especially when the price of the relevant stock doesn't go down. Unless the whole market collapses or does something weird like right now (like during the financial crisis) it's a win win for those lending out the stocks and for those selling short.  

The hedge funds that bet on GME to fail have to pay incredible sums to be able to short sell and the longer this goes on and the price goes up the more they have to pay.</text>

    <text>I think in the movie, the protagonists are just portrayed as being really smart and ahead of the curve. They're putting in their own money to say the economy is going to fall. Which is a totally fine thing to do.

What's happening now is that you have these big hedge fund firms saying GameStop is going to fall, which to some degree they could have been right. However since there's enough people buying the stock, the firms are going to lose a lot of money. If they had taken the loss, I don't think the firms would have been spotlighted as the bad guy, but in this case, there seems to be manipulation to prevent the average investor from winning.</text>

    <text>Another effect of a big hedge fund short selling a stock is that it could cause the stock price to go down. Imagine if you own a share of a company. Then you hear it's being shorted by a big investment firm. They must know something you don't. You may end up panicking and selling your position since why would an investment firm place that big of a bet in the first place. Also other investors will also see this and may cause them to sell as well. The more the supply there is, the lower the price. What's even worse if they have buddies(another investment firm or analyst) in wall street that will down grade your companies stock for no concrete reason. Which is how all this GME thing got triggered. The stock market is comprised of people and it has it's own psychology. Price movements can not be explained by statistics and mathematics alone.</text>

    <text>It's less fraud and more a flaw in the system. Definitely a gray area, but not outright illegal as far as I'm aware. It basically goes like this:

* Person A lends stocks to Person B
* Person B sells those stocks to Person C
* (at this point, there is one stock owed to one person--A)
* Person C, thinking they just have a normal stock, lends it to Person D
* Person D sells those stocks to Person E
* (at this point, there is only 1 stock, but it's owed to 2 people--A and C)

All of this can be sorted out quite easily if it moves back up the line. But what if, say, a bunch of redditers start buying stock and the prices rise and Person B panics and buys back the stock from Person E to give back to Person A. Well A and B are out of the woods, but C lost his stock and D is REALLY screwed.</text>

    <text>depends on your goal. If you wanna make a profit by selling the stock later at an even higher price, only do it if you can accept selling at a loss.

If you wanna mess with hedge funds and make their life hard and help WSB, then just buy some shares and hang on to them, no explanation needed.</text>

    <text>That is the big question, isn't it?

The only fact you should absolutely not underestimate with these things is this: ASSUME YOU WILL LOSE EVERYTHING INVESTED

If you cannot handle losing whatever you put into the market, you're at too much risk. Buying a stock is however very much safer than trying to short it, because a "short" can theoretically have an infinite loss for you, while buying a stock outright limits your loss to what you bought it for.

I'm assuming I've lost what I put in to this little adventure, but I might end up with a good profit. I don't know until I know.

This is not advising you to do anything, you have to make the decision yourself. But if you cannot bear losing it you should think *really* carefully if you actually want to gamble.

If I were a fiduciary I'd probably say you shouldn't jump on this, but as I'm not a financial advisor nor a fiduciary I simply cannot advise you on what *you* should do.

Other than to think. Thinking is good.</text>

    <text>Unfortunately, For compliance reasons I can’t give you advice. 

In my personal, non professional opinion that is in no way a recommendation: GME is not worth $500, nor anything like where it’s been trading the last few days. This demand is purely synthetic and defies the “market efficiency” theory. I personally worry for some who “got in at 290” because at the end of all this they will be SOL</text>

    <text>When the demand is higher than the supply (which is what's happening), the price starts to skyrocket because there's basically a "bidding war" to try and cover the shares.

Basically, the hedge fund people borrowed a bunch of GameStop stock, with the idea that they have to return it soon or start paying something like "late fees." They are contractually required to return it, but now it costs way more than they were expecting, and don't want to pay that much to buy it back so they can return it, but also have to return it, so they're in a bit of a bind. &lt;- from another comment but sums it up nicely</text>

    <text>If you are asking that probably not.  Its nearly inevitable it crashes back to ~$50 in under a month.  It might go up for the next week, but eventually the squeeze will end and people will start to look to exit their positions.  You only make money if you sell before the crash, which very well could have started today.</text>

    <text>So it's pretty simple really. They first sell low, then buy high (Ok it's not simple, but let's go through an example):

&amp;#x200B;

You decided to short XYZ's stock (and you currently own ZERO stocks). It's currently listed for **15 dollars/share and you decide to sell 100 of them**. That means you have **1500 dollars in your pocket**.

But wait a second, how can you sell something that you don't own? Well, you borrow it! So now that you've sold 100 stocks of XYZ you have to buy them back at a future date. 

Let's say the stock now sells for **7 dollars/share** and you decide to buy back the 100 that you sold. Doing the math this means you spent **700 dollars buying the stock**. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

To summarize:

1. You sold 100 of the stock (@ 15 $/share) and made **+$1500**
2. You bought 100 of the stock (@ 7$/share) and spent **-$700**
3. Thus, you made a profit of **$800**</text>

    <text>The problem is not short term but long-term. All these senseless buying has increased the value of the stock to a price that makes zero sense. Once the storm is over and hedge funds have been squeezed the natural forces of the market will reduce the prize of the stock to its 'natural' value. Buying at these prices is monumentally stupid from a financial perspective. It is basically just an expensive 'fuck you' to the system.</text>

    <text>So, I'm not 100% sure what you mean, but in buy low / sell high, you look for a stock whse current value is low but that you think will increase. You buy it while it's cheap. Then, when the value goes up, you sell it at a higher price than you bought it for, and pocket the difference. Buy for $1, sell for $2, make $1 in the process.

If someone buys a stock for $1 and then it becomes worth $0.50, they have two choices. If they think the stock will recover, they should wait until it's worth $1 or more again and then sell it. If they think the stock will keep going down and won't recover, they should sell it and get back $0.50, as they will only lose $0.50 overall, whereas if they wait until it's worth $0.10, they will lose $0.90.</text>

    <text>Short answer:  yes people are losing money, but only the money they have invested.  

Example if they bought a share of game stop at 200 bucks then it drops to 150 and they sell it. They lost 50 bucks.  But they can also make money if it jumps to 250 and they sell it they made 50 bucks. So they only actually lose what they initially invested if it drops to 0.

The hedge funds on the other hand it’s a little complicated.  They borrow the Share from the broker. Then they buy it back from the market at a lower price when it drops and sell it back to the broker and keep the profit.  

What’s happening is that the hedge funds borrowed GameStop stocks at a lower price Thinking they can hold on until it’s price drops lower then what they bought it for.   But REDDIT said FUCK YOU ASS HOLES!!! And they bought GameStop stocks and drove the price up!  So the hedge funds have to buy at a higher price resulting in loses.   This is what they do to Normal people everyday. And now the people are fucking them over.  Hopefully this helps.  I have not studied this since HS so hopefully this made sense.</text>

    <text>Ooof that’s a big question that requires a lot of background knowledge but I’ll try to keep it simple. 


An option as like a coupon. It gives the coupon holder the right to buy or sell stock, at a given price, on a given date. 

Think about it this way. If I think that the stock price of GME is going to go up in the near future, I can buy a coupon (technically a call option) that gives me the right to purchase the stock for a set price at a later date. So if GME is @ $20, I may buy a call option that gives me the right to buy GME stock for $20 per share exactly one month from now (expiration). The idea is that within that time frame; the gme stock price will increase, thereby making my coupon valuable because it allows the owner to buy at a discount. 

On the other side, you have someone who “writes” the contract. Essentially sells you the coupon. Let’s say GameStop is trading at $20, and you buy that $20 coupon. Well now, GameStop is trading at $400. So if your expiration is tomorrow you can “exercise” it, and the writer is required to deliver your shares for the agreed upon price, $20. To do that, they’ll probably have to go out and buy it at these exorbitant prices</text>

&gt;To invest in hedge funds as an individual, you must be an institutional investor or an accredited investor. Accredited investors have a net worth of at least $1 million, not including the value of their primary residence, or annual individual incomes over $200,000 ($300,000 if you’re married).

    <text>&gt;the lender can immediately terminate the loan and keep the cash deposit instead of getting the shares back. 

I thought the borrower will get margin called and forced to buy the shares and give them back to the lender. Is that not the case? Or does the lender sometimes choose to keep the cash and sometimes choose to force the borrower to buy shares to give back?</text>

    <text>Most shares are held by market makers. They act as a “bank for shares”. These shares are always for sale, and market makers constantly replenish the shares they have to provide liquidity in the float.
Liquidity just means it’s easy to trade, since there’s always available stock to trade, while float means the amount of available stock to trade.

The largest market maker in the GameStop fiasco is called Citadel, which coincidentally not only owns the hedge fund Melvin Capital (which had short positions in GameStop), but also provides 30% of Robinhoods profit. What does Robinhood provide in return for this 30% of profit? Order flow. Order flow is basically the information it gathers from traders.

This means Citadel has information on not only the trades that are coming in, but also the “limits” and “stop losses” that people set. So if they see that everyone had a stop loss of $300, they can use short strategies to drop the price to $300, which triggers these stop losses, and therefore creates more selling, which further drops the price. 

That’s why the price has continuously “tanked” before spiking right back up with GameStop.</text>

    <text>Shorting doesn't do anything to *make* them go bankrupt or anything like that.  It is just betting that the stock will be less valuable in the future.  Just like if you buy a stock normally you are betting the company will be more valuable in the future.</text>

    <text>So short selling doesn’t really involve signing a loan (on an institutional level). Trading firms/ hedge funds  require clearing firms (basically a bank for stock). These clearing firms typically maintain an “easy to borrow” securities list. For selling short, you are required to settle the trades in two business days. Large trading firms and hedge funds may sell the stock short, assuming they can borrow from that list easily within two days. The key here is you HAVE to settle in two business days</text>

    <text>Easiest way to explain shorting is borrowing stock you don’t own. Basically you can borrow someone’s stock, in this case GME, and sell it with the promise you will buy it back for the original owner at some point. You are betting the price will go down so you can buy it back at a lower price and keep the profit. 

For example: 
Hedge fund shorts GME AT $40/share. If the stock drops to $10/share they purchase it back at that price and keep the $30/share difference. The original owner doesn’t know what happened. (Very simplified version)</text>

    <text>Think of it like this: 

Your buddy loans you a suit for a wedding for free, what a pal!

The wedding gets cancelled, but instead of returning the suit, you loan it to a stranger online to make a quick $50. Unfortunately, the stranger completely ruined the suit, and now you have to go back to Armani and buy a brand new one for $1000 before your friend finds out</text>

    <text>There is never really “one share left”. Companies have a certain number of shares outstanding that are actively traded in the market (thousands to millions depending on the company). The number of people suddenly interested in buying up the stock is what represents the demand. The more buyers there are, the less sellers, so the price goes up</text>

    <text>I agree. I think most people are too overworked to be able to take some time and learn about the stock market, citizen rights, the law, basic chemistry etc. In an ideal world we would all have a solid basic understanding of all these things and thus wouldn't be so easily taken advantage of. But that's not what "the elites" want, because then society would be more equal (=less money for them).


So people stay clear of the stock market, pay an arm and a leg to a lawyer to fight their cases in court, buy overpriced cleaning products where a bit of vinegar would do the job, etc.</text>

    <text>Melvin Capital tried to short GME. They believed the company would keep losing value and they basically bet more shares than were available that the stock would keep falling. 

So if you had 10 shares of GME at $4.00 I might bet that the price would drop to $2.00. I borrow the 10 shares, promising to return them later. The price drops to $2/share and I buy back the shares I borrowed for less money, pocketing the difference of $20. 

But if the share price goes up to $6/share, now I still need to return the 10 shares, and I’m forced to buy them for $60.  Now I’m losing $20. 

If the stock went up further, my losses increase. Since the gains for the stock price are infinite, my loss is theoretically infinite.</text>

    <text>Index ETFs (QQQ, SPY, etc) until you don't have to ask that question on an ELI5. I'm sorry if that sounds condescending, it is not meant to be. It's just that, these ETFs are far more likely to be profitable over a long duration than if you just buy some stocks you read about. Maybe not in the short term, but over the long haul.

    <text>&gt; That just a ui blip or is that how stocks work?

That's how stocks work.

At that moment, it seems someone was selling a LOT of gamestop stock. This caused the price to tank. Such movements aren't surprising at the very last minutes of a trading day. 


&gt;Also, that dip in the afternoon looked weird. Like, it plateaued at $193 and wouldn't fall anymore?

The market closed at that moment, but extended trading hours were still on. However any order to buy or sell not for set for extended hours were canceled. It took a sec for extended hours orders to start coming in again.</text>

    <text>Good Q random internet person! To be clear, when you say “them or they” I understand you as  referring to market makers, hedge firms, hedge funds etc. when a stock is “halted” (sometimes called circuit breakers) - it is not done by any of “them”. That is done by the exchanges or regulators. They do this to help calm the markets in times of extreme volatility. This is actually a really good thing. It helps prevent total market collapses like the Great Depression</text>

    <text>The irony is that Robinhood itself has been the biggest gift to the hedge fund industry in years. Consider: in the 1990s (hedge fund heyday) there were maybe a couple hundred hedge funds. By 2002, this had grown to about 2,000. But by 2015, this had ballooned to over 10,000. At the same time, even the most basic investment institutions had adopted trading strategies which would have been considered "advanced" in the early days of hedge funds. In short, the easy money was gone, and the market had become far, far more efficient. What was once a sea of fat institutional investor tuna, ripe for the few shark hedge funds had become a sea of sharks. Enter E-trade and prime time CNBC. The ability for retail investors to directly day trade without prohibitive minimums or fees unlocked an entire ocean of tuna. Late to read information, poor at valuing complicated companies (or really any company), the retail day trader was the rube at the proverbial casino. The idea that the "rich" are trying to stifle retail investor activity is so backwards I can't even.</text>

    <text>UI blip. GME stock was swinging up and down all day, but it was a pretty steady decline in the afternoon after spiking up to $400+ right as the market opened and earlier in the morning. 

$193 was the price at market closing (4 PM Eastern Time for US stock markets), but after-hours trading saw the price rise back up into the $300+ range. Graphs will end when the market closes, but after-hours trading will continue to make the price fluctuate.</text>

    <text>99% of the people buying GME to attack hedge funds are restricted to buying the normal stock exchange hours. Other people, specifically the hedge funds, are not. The hedge funds are making it look like the stock is crashing in order to scare people and get them to sell. It goes back up  once we are allowed to buy again. Today's crash in the morning was right when robinhood illegally shut down buying GME.</text>

    <text>There are various things you can do. The OP mentioned calls, which are basically coupons that give you the right to buy a stock at a set price. Well there are also things called puts, which allow you to sell at a fixed price.

So one scenario, and that doesn't mean it happened here, is as follows:

Bob loans his GME shares, currently worth $20 each, to the hedge fund for a fee, let's say $2 per share. He can simultaneously buy a $20 put option from Steve for $1 per share. This basically means that Steve gets a $1 fee per share of GME stock now and he's obligated to buy the stock for $20 in the future if Bob wants to sell them at that price. It's basically insurance.

So now Bob made $2 per share from the call and bought a put (insurance) for $1 per share which will allow him to sell his stock at $20 regardless of the actual price. He's guaranteed to make at least $1 per share ($2/share call - $1/share put) and can sell his stock at $20 even if it goes down or can keep the stock if it goes up. His profits from the loan go down but so does his risk.</text>

    <text>GameStop got a new investor and CEO, Ryan Cohen, who has a great track record of building an e- commerce company and won again Amazon in a speciality market (pet food). He has plans to the company around and a lot people believe in him. That's why the price rose up and the whole thing started.</text>

    <text>Yeah, you can think of it like any other loan in that regard.  As a lender, what incentive do I have to loan you $100?  It would only make sense if I'm going to earn some interest on the loan. 

In the case of these stock transactions, there are some extra wrinkles to the math, too.  With a cash loan, the lender has some risk that they won't be repaid.  So the interest and fees (and perhaps collateral) offset that risk.  But when they are repaid, there's no chance that their $100 is worth more than $100 (inflation pedantry notwithstanding).

But as a lender of securities (stocks), they're going to get that stock back eventually.  But there's certainly some risk that the stock could be worth a lot less than $100 when it's returned.  So, they price the interest and fees on the loan based on that perceived risk.  But also, there's a chance that they could earn the interest and fees from the borrower *and also*  get back a share of stock that's worth *more* than when they lent it.  And that's part of what's happening in this gamestop situation.  

Jim lends me 1 share that's worth $100.  I pay him $5 in interest.  Some time later, I realize my bet backfired and the stock is now worth $200.  I sold Jim's share to Rhonda for $100 in the beginning, though. So I've got nothing but $105 in my pocket.  I need to repay Jim, though.  

Maybe I'll wait for the price to come down a little.  But someone's been buying up the stock.  Now no one will sell me a share for less than $300.  Suddenly, Jim is calling, saying, "Hey loser.  I need that stock back.  I want to sell it for $300."

Shit.  Everyone is on to my scheme.  They know I need to buy a share to repay Jim.  But they're refusing to sell!  Assholes.  One guy says he'll give me his share for $500.  Wait, I only have $110.  This is bad. 

So now, I have to borrow more money to buy the stock at an absurd price just so I can give it back to Jim.  Jim knows this insanity is temporary.  If he doesn't get his share back soon, then he won't be able to cash it in for $500.

So, I end up paying $500 for something that I thought would be worth $50.  Now all the other suckers like me are getting calls from their lenders, too.  Jim takes his share back and sells it to the next guy for $1000.  And so it goes until someone flinches.  At some point, the borrowers suck it up and repay their debts, and then all the lenders start trying to sell their repatriated shares, and all of the holders realize there's no more buyers, and when there's too many sellers and not enough buyers, the whole thing crashes down.  

The question is: at what price does this happen, and when?  My guess is that, for the most part, the big boys (fund managers who were the borrowers in this tale) outlast the majority of the meme boys (who would be dangling their shares over the heads of the borrowers who need them).  The smart memesters accept their ample windfall, give up "what could have been," and sell.  That trend picks up steam, and with no more buyers, the price begins to fall.  And the ones who are the most stubborn or greedy or "principled" or just...late...They're left holding shares with an asking price that no one will ever pay.  The price *quickly* falls to its correct, very low price.  The money managers lick their wounds and curse the clouds.  Many savvy and/or lucky retail investors have a story to tell and a hefty pile of cash to blow on the next terrible WSB idea that won't work in their favor.  And plenty more will just get in too late, sell too late, and lose basically all of their money.

And so it goes.  The little guy wins the battle for once.  But massive casualties are suffered on both sides.

Wow.  That was not how I intended my response for a five-year-old to turn out.  My thumbs hurt.</text>

    <text>If you are an investor you probably hold your shares through a broker of some sort. It is these brokers that lend out shares. Think of it like a bank for shares - they lend out shares that are just being held by investors in exchange for a fee. They demand collateral against these loans because they need to ensure they can get a share back (either from the person who borrowed it or by take the collateral and buying one in the market).</text>

    <text>Most people hold their shares in 'street name', which is usually the name of your broker. People do this because there's a fee to register the stock in your name, and it's a pain to change when you sell. But when you do this, it's easy for the broker to 'lend' your shares. Most account agreements have this buried somewhere in the fine print.

When someone wants to short a stock, their broker will look to see if they have any inventory in other clients' portfolios within their  own firm, and if so, will look after everything for the short-er. This can include charging the short a fee for borrowing the stock from another client. If the broker can't find it in his firm, he'll reach out to other brokers, but the fees are usually higher in this case. 

Finally - and this can be big - the short is responsible to pay any dividends on the borrowed stock to the person the stock was borrowed from for as long as the short maintains his position. So if I short XYZ, by borrowing stock from Joe Blow and selling it to Max Power, and XYZ declares a dividend of $1/share, I have to pay that dividend to Joe Blow. Max Power is going to receive the dividend from XYZ, not Joe, because Max is now the owner of that stock.  

So owning a stock costs you nothing, but shorting a stock can cost you fees to borrow and you might have to pay dividends on it as well. Meanwhile, your loss can keep getting higher and higher. It's not for the faint of heart!</text>

    <text>A broker is like a bank for shares. The broker lends you the shares just like taking out a bank loan. Again like a loan they charge you interest for the privilege of borrowing their shares. 

This is currently just an agreement between the broker and person planning on shorting the stock. No “buy” or “sell” has happened on the share market yet. 

Because I want to short the stock I go and place my sell order. Planning on buying it back later at the (hopefully) reduced price. The reason I can’t wait for the share price to go down forever (I.e I’m confident GameStop won’t be worth this much in 2050) is that I’ve still got that interest accruing on my third party agreement between myself and the broker.</text>

Imagine a stock spikes from $1 to $10 and falls back to $1. If you only play the uphill you can profit $9. Some who only shorts can also profit $9. Someone who times it perfectly can do both and make $18.</text>

    <text>You can do that if you have your friend’s permission. (And the home buyer is aware of it too.)

Shorting is allowed because it’s contractual, it’s not like someone is getting ripped off. 

Shorting also exposes you to unlimited loss potential. You have to return the stock that you borrowed. If you bet correctly, then by the time you return it, it will be cheaper than you bought it for, so you pocket the difference. If it goes up $1000 a share for some reason, you pay that $1000.

You’re not selling stocks you don’t have, you’re selling a stock that someone loaned you (for a fee) and then repaying them at a later date.</text>

You use this to sell the house, then wait for the housing market to crash, buy the house back and toss the keys back to your friend. He got your guaranteed cash for the trouble and you got whatever difference you made on the prices. 

Now, say the market doesn’t crash, houses become insanely expensive, and your friend is like, DUDE I’m freaking out, I don’t want any more of your money just buy it back and give me the keys!  This is the “short squeeze” situation they are trying to force.</text>

    <text>Houses don't work super well as an example because there is only one, lets use marbles instead.

Your friend has a bunch of marbles that he values at $1.50.

You think you know that marbles are going to drop in price shortly and will only be worth $0.50 tomorrow.

You go to your friend and ask to borrow a few marbles, telling him you'll return it tomorrow. He asks for at least $2.00 per marble in collateral so he knows you'll keep your promise. You borrow 10 marbles and give you friend a watch worth $30.00 with the condition that it will be returned when you give back his 10 marbles.

You then sell those marbles to other people at $1.50, earning $15.00.

The next day, marbles are now only worth $0.50. You go and buy 10 marbles for $5.00 and then go to your friend and give him the 10 marbles back in exchange for your collateral.

Your friend doesn't lose the 10 marbles, and you earned $10.00.

&amp;#x200B;

Now if you guess wrong, that's when the trouble starts.

The next day, marbles are now worth $1.75!!!!! Panic! You have to give your friend back 10 marbles today or you'll lose your collateral. Now you have $15.00, which can only buy you 8 marbles. You need to pay an extra $2.50 to buy 2 more marbles.

You go to your friend and give him back the 10 marbles in exchange for your collateral.

Your friend doesn't lose the 10 marbles, and you lost $2.50

&amp;#x200B;

This is why it's called a bet. It's gambling that the market will move in the way you predict.

The problem here is that you sold those 10 marbles, the marble price stayed the same - and now no one wants to sell you back any marbles. Maybe you'll buy three or four, but you still can't get your collateral back. Your watch is worth $30.00, which is the equivalent of 17 marbles valued at $1.75. That's not such a big loss, but the collateral used in borrowing shares is MUCH higher. Lets say your watch was worth $200. That's now worth 114 marbles valued at $1.75.

You would want to buy back marbles no matter the cost, which will raise the price of marbles. Everything has a price at the end of the day, and some people would be happy to sell you marbles valued at $2.25. So you buy three marbles at $1.75 and seven marbles at $2.25. You now lost $6.00 but could get your watch back.

However, what happened in this instance is that WSB encouraged people to NOT sell back at a slightly higher price.

That's like holding onto your marbles even if you get offered $10 per marble.</text>

    <text>Because stocks are commodities.  One unit of stock is identical to any other unit of that same stock, unlike houses.  So it's more like borrowing a cup of sugar from your friend, and then giving them a cup of sugar back after you've bought a fresh bag.  You're just hoping to buy that bag during a sale, cheap enough to cover the extra tablespoon you're giving them for being such a good friend (interest) and then some.

What's happening with $GME is that a bunch of neighborhood teens went and bought all the sugar from the local grocery stores, and they're refusing to sell it to you for less than 100x normal price &amp;mdash; all while your friend is getting pissed because he needs that sugar back from you to make a cake for his kid's birthday party tomorrow.  And every second you wait, the teens increase the price.</text>

    <text>The person who borrowed it must return the Xbox and then the person who loaned it can sell it.  Given the person who borrowed it doesn’t have it, they need to buy an new one at market price.  

Normally, there are not too many short sellers so you can always find someone willing to sell you an Xbox at market price.  

What happens with GameStop is that people realised that there were tons of people doi this borrow and sell idea (short selling) and if someone wanted to get their Xbox back and sell it themselves, there were way too many borrowers and not enough real people who actually owned one.   It’s like you lent money to someone and everyone out there is deep in debt with credit cards.  

But they must pay back the debt.  The only way they can do that is to offer a lot of money to the few people who actually own an Xbox / a real share in GameStop.</text>

    <text>Options do have expiration dates, but a regular short sell does not. 

If you have enough capital to keep your margin account funded and fees paid, you can absolutely ride out a stock runup until it comes back to earth... but when a stock goes up like 10-15X like gamestop did, it's almost impossible to have that much liquid cash available.

    <text>First up it’s important to know brokers who have lent the shares don’t want to chase people for money or accept risk themselves. With that in mind...

I borrow a share of GME while it’s @ $10. I sell it planning on shorting the stock, knowing I need to buy it in the future to “return” it. I can make a maximum of $10 (this occurs if GME is worth $0 when I need to return it, I.e they have gone bankrupt). 

The price of GME goes to $15. The broker will want me to have around $15 in my account to demonstrate I have the finances to actually purchase and return the share I borrowed. If the share goes up to $50 they want me to have $50 in the account. It’s the only way the broker doesn’t assume the risk themselves. If I have a particularly good relationship with the broker they may only want me to have a portion of the funds in my account (I.e. $30), but it’s certainly more than the original $10 I spent. 

If the price is going up very rapidly the broker will often say “you have 24 hours to put money into the account that is the equivalent of X% of these shares total current value or we will have to buy back the share you owe us at whatever the current price is, it’s the only way we can guarantee it doesn’t get riskier for us”. 

With all that said, to directly answer you it’s normally the cash value in the account. You can either deposit more or liquidate holdings in other stocks to get that cash balance up. If you don’t do it, the brokers will.</text>

    <text>It's usually your portfolio. Brokers will set a limit to how much you're allowed to be indebted to them as a percentage of your equity. This number is called your margin.

Like, say I have $1000 cash in my portfolio, and I decide to short-sell 100 shares of a $10 stock. Now I have 2000$ cash in my portfolio, and a debt of 100 $10 shares, for a margin level of 50%.

Now, say my brokerage's max margin level is 50% of my equity, and those shares I shorted actually increase in price to $11. Now I have a debt of 100 $11 shares. This puts me over the 50% margin threshold (1100/2000=55%).

At this point, the brokerage isn't going to let me take any new positions (either short or long) until I'm back under the 50% limit. To do that, I can either close out my short position and take the L, or I can deposit more money into my account, and hope the price falls.

Now lets say the price REALLY goes up, say to $20. Now, my margin is at 100%. At this point, the brokerage is going to be pretty worried that I'm going to end up owing them more than they can collect, and they do what's called a "Margin Call." Basically, a Margin Call is an ultimatum for me to deposit more money into my account, or they're going to liquidate my account. Any stocks I may have bought will be auto-sold at the current market price, and the cash will be used to auto-buy shares at current market price to close out my shorts.

Now, here's a REAL fun question: What if I've shorted a company so much, that I owe way more shares than actually exist, and I get Margin Called? My broker can't auto-buy stock that doesn't exist, so what happens? This is the question r/wallstreetbets decided to find the answer to, and so far, it seems like the answer is that share price approaches infinity. Bc once all the shares that are listed for sale get sold, someone can list shares for whatever ask price they want, and I have to buy it, doesn't matter if it's $100, or $100,000.</text>

    <text>Usually you have to have enough other assets in your account to cover loan.  In this case the hedgefund would own millions of dollars in other stocks, and have a few million cash on hand.  If the short goes bad they have assets they can use to cover the loan.

In this case specifically the short went so bad they nearly ended up broke, they didn't have enough assets to cover their losses.  The lender called in the short and forced them to liquidate before this short put them into bankruptcy and they wouldn't be able to pay them back in full.</text>

    <text>&gt; Which will ultimately be bad or all sides,

Your opinion is your right, of course, but I don't think it's bad. The hedgies think nothing of swinging their billion dollar di..cash hoards around, and they don't give a shit who gets hurt. For once, the tables are turned, and they get screwed. Sorry, Mortimer, we're not turning the machines back on. 

Please note: you are not supposed to be investing with a hedge fund with next month's rent. These are supposed to be risk mitigation assets for the very wealthy. So if a couple of hot shots managing the assets of a bunch of rich rent-seekers manage to lose everyone's money to a bunch of poor people, I for one am not going to shed any tears.</text>

    <text>Correct; neither buying or shorting a stock are market manipulation. The market manipulation is all the discussions and agreements that WSBers have made to all buy at the same time and refuse to sell.</text>

    <text>It’s mostly the fees that they are collecting. They are more or less indifferent about the shares since they are holding it on behalf of other investors. Think of it like a parking garage - people park their cars there and they are kept safe and clean, but the garage company can lend out the cars as long as they get them back.</text>

    <text>Well you’re not really as concerned about the value of shares. As a broker you have access to the shares in the accounts you manage. It’s like running a rental car business - you can lend out cars but you just need to make sure your inventory of cars is squared up in the end.</text>

You get 10 bags of weed and you promise your mid level dealer that you'll give him that 10 bags back in two days. You flood the market with that weed, so now everyone has weed, so noone wants to buy and so the other dealer in your area has to give them away for 5 a piece. You buy back the 10 bags for 50 schmeckels and give it back to your dealer. 

If you bet wrong and trees come flooding your turf and weed goes on to be in high demand, you can only buy your shit back at 15 a piece or your legs get broken.</text>

    <text>If you don't mind me asking, why would they have made millions? Even if I did buy my shares at $20 and sold them at $200, it'd still only be 10x right? I just can't imagine any ordinary redditor having more than $1k to put in this gamble, in a failing business no less. That would only be 10k returns, barely a few months of salary for an entry level job.

I'm just curious why everyone is making it out as if redditors be rich over night? Am I missing something or am I vastly underestimating how much wallstreet bets places their gambles?</text>

    <text>Absolutely, and what we are seeing is the market naturally correcting this obvious overshorting. Some have accused the gamestop short sellers of doing exactly what you describe "driv\[ing\] the stock so low shareholder has no choice but to abandom ship even if the company can still function" so that they bankrupt the company and they NEVER have to pay the shares back. There is suspicion that in order to get to 140% shorted the short sellers had to resort to illegal practices like naked short selling [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nakedshorting.asp#:\~:text=Naked%20shorting%20is%20the%20illegal,before%20they%20sell%20it%20short](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nakedshorting.asp#:~:text=Naked%20shorting%20is%20the%20illegal,before%20they%20sell%20it%20short).</text>

    <text>These are actually really really complicated and very good questions. I can't explain them that well here but i'll try.

What's an example of an " inefficiency" in a market? - Enron is a classic example the company was doing all sorts of shady shit but nobody found out until short sellers.

Is it really that big of a deal anyway? - that's kinda an individual question. The promise of a free market is "pareto effeciency" which is to say that it promises that nobody can be made better off without making someone else worse off. When you create ineffeciences that promise breaks down.

Are there really no other ways to prevent "inefficiencies"? there might be but they are very very complex and hard to do. Shorting is a good regulatory mecahnism in that sense.

Doesn't this just sound like paper-thin justification for hedge funds to make lots of money in ways only they can? - not at all, in fact regular investors can also short stock, all you need is a margin account or one with options trading enabled. You can't do shady things like naked shorting, but that's illegal anyway. Hedge funds will bend/break the rules because the rich can, banning shorting is not likely to be the way to fix it.</text>

    <text>so simply by NOT SELLING(holding with diamond hands? as the kids are saying), they're still sticking it to the people that risked money they didn't have on shares that don't exist?

Can the shares still be bought through other services?

At what point will regulators actually get involved?

Sorry for all the follow ups, I'm just curious and this is all completely new to me. Thanks for your replies so far</text>

    <text>You borrow the stock from the owner, promising them you’ll return their stock at a later date + a small fee.  You do this because you think the stock price is going to drop soon.

You sell the stock for $500.  The company takes a nose dive and stock is now worth $5.  You buy back the 1 stock, return it to the owner, and pay the 1% of the original price or whatever you agreed upon.  You made $490 and the stock owner has their stock back plus an extra $5.</text>

    <text>Ah ok! I have an easier time understanding this thinking more with goods, not dollars. You have 5 pens. Today(Fri), I borrow them from you. I then sell them to my mom.  
You have -5 pens  
I have 0 pens &amp; owe you 5  
my mom has 5 &amp; owe 0  

*Saturday*  
My mom sells all 5 to my dad.  
My mom has 0 &amp; owes 0  
My dad has 5 &amp; owes 0  
I have 0 &amp; owe 5

*Sunday*  
My dad's barber borrows the 5 pens from my dad  
My dad has 0 &amp; owes 0  
My mom has 0 &amp; owes 0  
I have 0 &amp; owe 5  

Amongst you, me, my mom, dad, and his barber, there are only 5 pens that moved around. But because me and the barber each owe 5 pens to *someone*, there's 10 pens to be owed. 1 pen = 1 share.</text>

    <text>You got it! The exciting part is when they have to unravel all of those long/short positions. Suppose the price soars to $120. Amy sees this and tells Billy, "hey can you give me back my stock? I want to cash it in."

Well now Billy's in a jam. He needs to return the stock to Amy but it's much more expensive than the $100 he sold it for. Now he has to buy a share from somebody, anybody at $120. And he has to do it quickly or else he's in contractual breach, so perhaps Billy has to overbid $130 to get this done.

Now the price rises to $130 and Charlie wants to cash in too. He tells Darryl, "hey can you return my stock asap?" Darryl's stuck too, he has to find a stock for Charlie and he also has to pay whatever price he can find. Darryl talks to Eva and says "can I buy that stock back from you?"

Eva says to Darryl, "sorry I can't sell it to you anymore. A bunch of people from WSB just swooped in offering me $350 for the stock. I already sold it, you have to go talk to them."

And that's how the short squeeze happens.</text>

    <text>So like, the robinhood fiasco is a big deal because if redditors can’t buy up all the stocks before the brokerages get them, the brokerages can make their money back by just selling them back and forth between themselves? Thats why the price has been dropping? Thats stupid that they can churn the stocks back and forth. Also is it too late for redditors to do anything if enough stocks were bought back by the rich?</text>

    <text>In general, the people they borrowed the stocks from are charging fees that get bigger and bigger the longer it takes before they get their stocks back. So for some of them, waiting too long isn't really that good of an option, because then they'll lose money from the late fees on returning the stocks.   


As for how does it get decided who gets a stock if there's multiple buyers, most of this is handled by computer programs these days, and raising prices in response to multiple people trying to buy it, and seeing if they're still interested at the new price is how it's done, to the best of my knowledge.</text>

Hope this answers your question. I'm not sure if the statements that Porsche made running up to their buy constitute "market manipulation" but the way they stated things made people feel one thing, and then Porsche went and did another thing altogether.</text>

    <text>So those aren’t stocks. Those are call options to buy GME stock at $8 expiring on the various dates. 

Action: Close: means to close the contract by selling it back
Roll: sell this contract and buy a one for a future expiry date
Execute: to execute the contract and buy 100 shares of GME at $8 per contract (not shown since the stocks on the market were probably &lt;$8 so no point in executing)


Qty: quantity of options (not stocks). Each option grants the right to buy 100 stocks at a predetermined price ($8)

Bid: what someone is willing to pay for this option 

Ask: what someone is asking for this option in the market 


The rest are fine but they refer to options pricing, not stock</text>

    <text>Don’t feel dumb at all! 

And yes, correct it is the shareholders profit
If you go on sec.gov, top right under company filings you can find the public information that the companies publicly traded need to put out for investors (mainly the 10-k or the most recent 10-Q , 10-K is the audited financial statements) 
In there it tells you how much money they owe, what they make in operations, what they own, their plans their risks etc, and based off this you can see that GameStop has been consistently losing millions of dollars every single year 

So these finance guys make models that predict based off complicated equations and spreadsheets what they believe things are actually worth, based on all the accounting 

For example, let’s say you have a car
Let’s say the blue book value is 5,000
But you know it actually has a lot of issues so it’s worth more around 3,000
So if someone buys it for 5000, sees it has issues they’ll sell for 4000
And theoretically after a lot of buying and selling it’ll reach it’s true price 

But what if that car is the car my parents drove as a kid and so I have sentimental value attached to it? So I’ll offer you 6000
Does that make it clearer?

What happened with the GameStop, AMC, etc is that these guys bet and NEED the car, so say there’s only 10 of that model in existence, and the other 9 people aren’t selling (what is happening) you can say I’ll give you the car for 50,000 and they would have to pay it 
So although the car is only worth 3, I would give 6 because I want it for whatever reason, and the guys who bet would pay infinite amount since they legally need it</text>

    <text>You’re right that if a company is doing well, someone would pay what it’s worth (or even higher if they believe it’s worth even more)
That’s what happens with healthy companies (ie Apple), the company gets bigger and bigger and you get gain on your initial investment 


Oh another thing is that companies raise money by either selling/providing goods and services, debt (ie a loan) or equity (stocks)

A loan is straightforward, they get money in exchange for paying interest and principal back over tine

Equity is different, it’s saying we’re going to sell a portion of the company to you in exchange for money, so you actually get to keep the share of the company (and can buy and sell as you please) in exchange for the company raising money 

Does that help clarify anything? I know I’m rambling a lot</text>

    <text>No problem. Just to be clear about the last 2/3 of my comment I mean that in less than two hours the price of a share of gamestop swung from $274 to $468 and then to $125.

It's not about being 2 weeks late on selling. Being even 20 minutes late to sell may be enough time for you to miss out. Other than that, your assumption is correct.

There is a way to declare "I'd like to buy at X price, and then sell at XXX price." You could ask your advisor if this could be set up. But honestly this GME situation is closer to gambling than investing. Your financial advisor will likely strongly recommend against getting involved with GME right now.

If you end up doing this,I would recommend treating it like a day at the slot machines, and not put in more money than you'd be comfortable doing there.

And yeah, financial education at my school sucked as well. There are good books, podcasts, and videos on it. But it does take several years to really get a comfortable knowledge of it when self studying.</text>

    <text>The interest charges are astronomical. Like in the month of January it has cost them probably 10 billion just to keep these positions open. And that isn't factoring in the loss when they have to buy back the shares because yes at some point the lender will say hey I need those shares right now and that will force the person who borrowed them to buy at current market price which will cause market price to go up which is just a cascade to everything else. 

For perspective, in 2020 Tesla cost the shorts somewhere around 40 billion in losses. Gamestop has done a decent chunk of that damage in less than a month.

 It's less of a when does this expire type of thing and more of a when do I live in a cardboard.box type of thing.

As for no stocks to buy a lot of retail does have some sell orders in place. They just happen to be at crazy levels like 10k+ per share levels. In which case these funds will be forced to buy at those levels.</text>

    <text>Ah right, I see. The reason brokerages do this is because this isn't very risky for them (but very risky for you), since they can force the sale of the other investments in your account if the total value of your account is reached by the loss on a short position. In other words, it would be very unusual for an account to end up significantly in the negative, unless there's a sudden spike in value.

For example, if my account holds 2000$ in value, and I short a stock worth 500$, the value of that stock can quadruple until I'm forced to sell positions or deposit more cash.</text>

    <text>Oh sorry. Contract expirations are fixed on certain days of the month/week. Because the expiration isn’t a specific date the investor can set people can infer when the options expire. 

Referring to volume of shares you can usually tell a hedge fund is shorting a stock because of the massive amount of shares being sold.</text>

    <text>I would also like to know this. I’m relatively up to speed with the basics of what happened, but I can’t see why the shareholder wouldn’t just sell the share if it’s expected to fail. I’ve seen people saying the original owner can charge a fee to borrow, but does that really cover much if the stock tanks?</text>

    <text>Well as much as I would advise against this, because it fucks things up for autist apes like myself who will hold until GME reaches Venus, you could always just ride it up shortly and sell whenever you are happy with your % gain. Doesn’t have to be a specific amount. 

I like to go by the rule:

&gt;*”Good enough to screenshot, good enough to sell”.*

It is also unlikely for them to go bankrupt within the next couple of days

Tesla is one of them but it was more of a slow squeeze overt the course of months. This one is a bit faster.</text>

    <text>&gt;Even better than the one before, thank you. So in order to close the deal, Bert needs to buy back 3 apples from Carl to give back to Alice and Danny needs to buy them back from (let's call her) Emily to give back to Carl? But Carl can't sell them back to Bert because he hasn's got them anymore.

Well, Bert doesn't need to buy apples from Carl, even he sold them to him. He just needs to go to the market and buy 3 random apples. Same goes for Danny. Usually that's not a problem, because under normal circumstances there should be enough apples going back and forth. Maybe Emily is one of the traders I mentioned in the very beginning. So she throws the 3 apples back to the market. So all 5 apples are being traded back and forth. Maybe on some days it's just 3, on other days it's all 5. Bert is able to get the 3 apples on the market and give them back to Alice. And if Danny is bit lucky and Alice sells one apple, there are 3 apples available again, so he can buy them, too, and give them back to Carl (btw I confused a name in the example above and edited the post, but it looks like you got it right).

The thing is, if Alice sees the price for apples go up (for whatever reason), she begins to worry, that Bert might not be able to buy them back. She calls Bert and demands her apples back (that's a margin call), she can do it anytime, if she sees Bert can't afford them anymore, if the price keeps rising. So Bert goes to the market and asks people, if they have apples. That itself makes the apples' price go up, because demand does that. Carl sees that the price for apples goes up and calls Danny, to demand his apples back. So Danny needs, just like Bert 3 apples. Now what? 2 people are at the market, looking to buy 3 apples each, so 6 apples, though there are only 5 apples in total (and maybe aren't even in the float, depending on what Emily did with the apples she bought from Danny). Sellers are now in the position, where they can theoretically demand infinite money for their apples, hence the term "infinity squeeze", because no matter what, there just are not enough apples for Bert and Danny to buy.

That whole process, where one short seller (Bert) gets margin called, which on the other hand makes other short sellers get margin called (Danny) is called "Short Squeeze". 

&gt;Are there any contracts between all these people on deadlines, or that Bert can get the apples only back from Carl and nobody else?

There are other market mechanics, that include deadlines. That would be an option. That would be something else, but just like short selling a possibility a profit from a declining market (Bert and Danny want to buy a "put option" to profit from a declining market). There are also options to profit in a rising market, a "call option".

Second question should be answered by now.

&gt;And what's happening now is that Bert gets nervous to give the apples back to Alice but can't buy them anywhere for less than he sold them, right?

Yeah, he can, if he gets nervous and wants to cut losses. Or, if the price goes further up, Alice will demand her apples back from him, see above.

Anything unclear or do you have more questions?

EDIT: Included "call options"</text>

    <text>Yes - that company is called a "market maker". That market maker is the primary broker for engaging trades for Robinhood's platform. Market makers typically stabilize the prices of stocks by owning the stockpiles of the shares and presenting typically prevailing bid/ask prices.

Market makers are obligated to own shares to provide price stability. Whenever an investor takes a call options contract on the GME stock, the market maker has to hedge the call by purchasing the stock. This action massively overleveraged the brokerage firm, creating an equities crisis. In order to protect the brokerage firm against overleveraging their balance sheet, they restricted positions on the trade.

This is an extremely ordinary practice, and is a very natural consequence of the fact that the market has complex financial instruments that allow market actors to engage with different risk styles. If the stock market was simply all long calls from cash accounts, then it would make no sense, but the reality is that the full financial system is taking on risks as well by providing these instruments. This is simply Robinhood indicating that they can no longer acquire the risk. In fact, this night alone Robinhood had to borrow hundreds of millions of dollars in bank loans simply to meet their capital requirements. Had they not restricted the asset, it would only have been worse for them.

My only curiosity is your framing it as a "bail out". I'm not sure why. Is it a bail out if I buy a hamburger from McDonald's?</text>

    <text>I don’t follow - a short sale is exactly the same as the classic “buy low, sell high”, they just flip the order.  I guess you could say that the other shareholders are losing out since their holdings are by definition worth less if a short is successful - they held on to an investment that is now worth less.

If the other shareholders don’t sell, then the share price isn’t going to fall at all. It’s what’s happening in GME.</text>

    <text>I think many people don't fully understand crypto ...

First of all, it's not just a program with an arbitrary price attached to it. It offers actual real-life value, today.

But besides that, it's not just simply Bitcoin (or doge) or any other cryptos that are trying to emulate money. There are several other projects that are currently working on the concept of decentralized Finance, which can replace insurance companies, financial institutions and basically all other institutions that offer contractual agreements. 

You'd have a system that is decentralized, not controlled by any one entity and censorship-proof. These are systems that already work right now!

The only reason they haven't already replaced these legacy-systems yet, is because the current Blockchain solutions don't scale well for this many users. In other words: Too many people are trying to use cryptos. But all crypto projects have been working on scalability solutions to make them more viable and usable.

Additionally, if you want to buy stocks, you can also do that through some crypto projects that offer synthetic assets for commodities and stocks. Meaning, you can actually invest in stocks via the purchase of synthetic assets on a blockchain that are pegged to real-life counter-parts.

If you think this is solely about monopoly-money, you're mistaken</text>

So the original stock holder has no contract. He owns the stock outright, he can sit on it forever.  As they say, you only lose if you sell. 

So probably in a lot of these cases the stock holder is *hoping* the stock appreciates, because let's be real, these 2 people aren't friends. By lending out his stock, its a win-win for him. If the stock gains, his "buddy" has to actually lose money to return it to him, and now you can turn around and sell it since it's high, and wait a few days and buy it back low.</text>

Naked short selling is illegal. There are certain institutions that can do it legally but it's not exactly a common thing</text>

    <text>In a naked short you are taking advantage of the time it take to formally settled a trade. You try and find a share during that time frame, so that when the time to settle arrives, you have a share you can deliver.</text>

    <text>GameStop is going out of business and hedge funds took a financial position that reflected that reality.

Retail investors responded by inflating the price of an asset of a failing business, generating a credit crisis in the process. In the end, many people will lose a lot of money, and those people probably won't blame Reddit, they'll blame Wall Street for some reason.

Financial institutions can be corrupt, but this just isn't a case of any wrongdoing, in my opinion.</text>

    <text>Yup. Basically. 

What happened with WSB, is that they caught the company with their pants down short selling stocks. Instead of the company getting the chance to buy back the stocks for literal dirt cheap, a group of random dumbasses on Reddit bought all the stocks instead lol. Creating the exact opposite domino effect, making more people buy the stocks, making the price go way up.

Because group 1 (the hedge fund) was short selling stocks that they borrowed from group 2 (GameStop), it was never “their stocks” to begin with. So now they’re forced to buy back the borrowed stocks from redditors, no matter how high the price is. 

And thus, the hedge fund Melvin Capital lost billions of dollars and is on the path of bankruptcy lmao</text>

    <text>That sounds like a population problem at its core, due to lack of resources. A flourishing economy gives us the ability to invest in clean energy. 

Tesla? They’re not perfect but they’re revolutionary to the auto market by providing electric vehicles which reduce greenhouse emissions. Solar companies? An alternative energy source to oil. Research and development by these companies? THIS is what will further reduce our reliance on fossil fuels.

Look at India and China. Not as developed. Population problems. Pollution problems. Now look at the progress we’ve made in the last 30 years. 

My point is, we are making the most out of the system that has brought us so much prosperity. In my opinion, we have the best chance of combatting our environmental problems.</text>

    <text>I don't think anything wsb has done is illegal. The hedge funds on the other hand went on cnbc and said they exited gamestop, when they have not. They demonizes wsb when it's not just wsb that are taking advantage of the trap the hedges set themselves up with. Wsb alone couldn't have done it. I'm positive other medium and large investors are also taking advantage of the situation. Robinhood today, for example, blocked buying of GME but allowed selling while hedges traded with each other to control the price. That should be illegal.</text>

    <text>I can't possibly comment on the amount of wealth people have in those who lead statements with what qualifies as "rich". So I will not provide a contradiction. In fact I'm impressed you can.

Notice that, in a subject where I lack knowledge, I simply just shut up. Also notice that the subject regarding the wealth of individuals defining "rich" is not a subject that likely anyone gives a shit about. Perhaps you can find someone asking specifically that question and you can offer your knowledge on it. I assume there are none, however.</text>

    <text>Fidelity has been mentioned a few times but dont expect to sign up and start trading tomorrow. I would highly recommend paper trading first. Its trading with fake money. You can even just do it at home. Write down shares you want to buy and how much onto a piece of paper. Then check back a few weeks later to see how you did. Maybe you made money, maybe you lost it. It will give you an idea of how it all works and the risks involved.

    <text>Yes, and mathematically and logically, it will. 
Hedge Funds have to buy back the shorts they sold to give the shares back to the original buyers. Only now it’s incredibly expensive for them to do so, which is why the shenanigans of yesterday occurred. 
If people continue to hold, the HF buying back will drive the price up even further, as they have to buy back every single share of GME more than once.</text>

    <text>Imagine it's 1995 and I have a rare Beanie-Baby. You believe that Beanie-Babies are a good investment and will grow in value. You offer me $1000 for my Beanie-Baby with the expectation that in 25 years you will sell that same Beanie-Baby to someone else for $10,000. I accept your offer because I want $1000 more than I want that Beanie-Baby.

It's 2021 and no one gives a flying fuck about Beanie-Babies anymore. You can't find anyone willing to buy the one you bought from me. You still own it, but it's worthless. It can't drop in price any farther than it has - you can't owe *more* money on it; but neither can you recover the money you've already spent.

That's basically what's going on here. The $1000 is already gone. You used it to pay for a thing, which you now own. The worst that can happen is that you won't be able to sell that thing that you own because nobody wants it. It's not the fault of the person who sold you the thing that the thing is worthless, especially since they had no idea that it would be worthless. For all you or they knew, someone else could have wanted to buy it for ten times what you paid for it. That's not how it worked out, though.</text>

    <text>Oh I thought you meant **to you**.

The worst that could happen is that everyone holds onto their stocks, doesn't allow them to buy, drives up the price to the point where they are spending all their money to get them back and the go out of business.

Let's use a possible example of what might happen.

Let's say 20MM shares need to be be bought back in one day by the short sellers.

20,000,000 \* $200  is $4B.

But as they buy in order to return back, if noone is selling, they are driving the price up ($300 = $6B) and up ($600 = $12B) and up ($1000 = $20B).

All that money would be taken from those who are short selling (hedge funds) to those who are holding (retail investors, wsb, etc).

One of the hedge funds was bailed out the other day with $3B. So I don't know if they have another $12B to go?

\--

As I type this all out, it's pretty incredible, so I'm doubting myself that I have the situation and the numbers right.</text>

    <text>Here's where something interesting called a ladder attack and market manipulation happens. You and your buddies convince all the other orange vendors to stop allowing the buying of oranges to people that aren't you and only allow them to sell oranges they already have by effectively stopping the price of them going up and only enabling it to go down while only you and your friends  are allowed to buy more. You and your buddies collude to keep selling the same oranges you do have back and forth to each other over and over for cheaper prices each time making it look like a big sell is happening and forcing the price of the oranges to go down, all while only you and your buddies are allowed to buy oranges. You just now broke the law but you achieved your goal of making some people panic and sell their oranges to you after seeing the steep plunge you just created in their prices and making them think it's crashing. They also made money by shorting the orange price before having their buddy vendors not allow the buying of oranges to anybody but you and your buddies and when the price dropped they were able to make money. This is what happened today but based on the information we have, not many of the people besides the rich folks actually sold their oranges, you just tried to make them worth less to lessen the money you owe. You successfully tanked the sale of oranges from nearly $500 to $120 but since barely anybody else got tricked into selling the price ended up correcting itself mostly and went back up to over $300. After this huge manipulation today, you now broke the law blatantly and only went from having to buy 140% of the number of oranges that exist to 130% and are possibly in an even worse situation than you were before because the people you tried to screw over are seething with anger and can't wait to buy more oranges as soon as your buddy vendors are forced to allow oranges to be bought again from anybody</text>

    <text>It would be double if the purchases were at the same price - but it’s quite likely that between the two purchases the price will go up significantly because everybody willing to sell at the first price have already sold. The price might hover at a round or meme number if many people have sell orders at that price, but once that pool is exhausted it’s on to the next chunk of sell orders. 

What I don’t understand is what *forces* the short sellers to buy shares and return them. Why couldn’t they just walk away and say “nah, not returning what we borrowed.” I suppose it’s simply illegal, but with this much money involved we’ve seen what the Uber rich can get away with.</text>

    <text>No, not really. You just have to pay whatever the apple-holder wants, or deal with the consequences of not honoring your foolish bargain. 

Apparently for the hedge funds those consequences are so apocalyptic that it's not really an option to *not* return both apples.</text>

If you agree to write(sell) your 100 shares and I agree to buy(call) 100 shares then we have a contract.

    <text>The effect of a Gamma squeeze is much less then a short squeeze. The volume of stock that needs to be secured is an order of magnitude lower. Every single short position eventually needs to be covered, maybe less then 10% of the ITM options likely still need to be bought. It will definitely add price pressure but no where near what an actual short squeeze looks like. You're right though, the gamma squeeze could be the match that lights the powder. Tomorrow should be wild.</text>

    <text>At the edge of my understanding here. It goes multiple layers deep. First the hedge fund would need to go under, then the broker, then the clearinghouse. After that, there is an entity (company? Agency?) that guarantees the market, basically saying if you want to sell what you own, you can. 

Other much smarter people than I have written about this, and I'm sure I'm wrong on bits.</text>

    <text>There's no time limit at all, rather there's a solvency limit.

Think of it more in terms of "renting" stocks. After all, even today there's going to be some GME holders that will let a billionaire borrow their stock enough money a day.

Eventually though, those billionaire hedge funds begin looking like they can't afford the interest payments. You begin wondering if their books make sense at all, and eventually turn them away.

At *that* point, they're fucked.</text>

    <text>So a clearing firm is like a bank. You probably have a checking account, savings account etc. the bank keeps track of your money, and when you swipe your card, they guarantee the funds will be available. 

A clearing firm is very similar to a bank. A clearing firm  has accounts that hold stock. Trading firms spend their days trading back and forth, and the stock is deposited into their accounts at the clearing firm. They also. Guarantee all of their clients (trading firms) transactions. 

Trading firms will sell stock short frequently as a regular part of business assuming they will be able to get their hands on the shares within two days for settlement.  That is really what selling short is most commonly. So when everyone assumes they can just get the shares when needed, it becomes a frenzy when everyone tries to get them at the same time</text>

    <text>People who take up a short position have to pay interest on that position if they continue holding. That’s how the lender makes money. Shorting a stock can make your losses infinite theoretically, because if the price skyrockets, you’re now on the hook for purchasing those stocks at that price. If you had taken a long position, and the price goes to 0, then you only lose what you put in.</text>

    <text>You buy "market" tomorrow morning, then sell "limit" at some higher price than you paid. If you wanna go all-in and hope that the hedge funds will somehow find the liquid cash they need to fill all their obligations,  then set your sell price at something ridiculous like $1000. 

Only do that if you're comfortable with a) the sale being cancelled by the brokers because apparently they do that now, b) prices spiking, but not quite high enough, or c) any other reason that the stock market does things. A more conservative strategy would be to make a sell order for a more modest gain, as there's a higher chance that a broker (or redditor, at this point) will buy it in the frenzy.

    <text>There is a difference between market buys/sells and limit buy/sells. Limit means that you enter the price that you want to buy or sell at. Market is whatever the price is at that moment the order is submitted. One thing to be aware of before you make any decisions is to be aware that GME has fluctuated wildly this past week, going from $112.25 to $483 per share even just today. If you had submitted a market buy around 10am when it was $483, you would have bought the stock then at $483. If you had instead entered a limit buy at 10am for $112.25, you would've not bought the stock instantly, but you would have eventually managed to buy the stock for that price when the stock price fell to that price around 11:20am. Of course, there is no guarantee that your limit buy order would've executed when you submitted at 10am since you can't see what happens in the future, so there is an unknown aspect in limit buy orders and when/if they'll execute. Conversely, when you are ready to sell, you can submit a particular price that you want to sell at and if someone is willing/forced to buy it for that much, then that order will execute and you will have sold it for whatever price you set. You can also market sell which will be whatever price is at the market at that moment you submit. In the event that the price goes down quickly and you want to get out quick, go with the market sell rather than the limit sell. Note this is not financial advice and I am not suggesting that you take any particular action or do anything. I am not a financial advisor, just a retard.</text>

    <text>I don't think that's right.   It makes the barrier to entry higher, but the lucrativeness of any short is just based on the difference between start and end, right?  If it loses 95% of it's value, that's a 20x return.  Seems like the more expensive it is, the more you have to gain if it approaches zero.</text>

Why would brokers want to "lend" shares? Are they just gambling that people predict wrong and end up having to spend more to return the share? How do they profit from that? Stonks give me the big confus, but I feel like they can be an easy way to make money if you learn it.</text>

Is anyone allowed to lend stocks they own to others? And if you are holding stocks wouldn't it always be in your best interest for the stock price to rise? Or if you suspect a stock will fall is that then incentive to try and loan it to someone trying to short?</text>

    <text>Getting away from the house/renter thing, do you have a good analogy for buy and sale thing?

Like Person A has 1 share of Company A that is currently being traded for $1/share. Person B comes in and offers to “borrow” the share for like $0.10, Person B actually comes in and sells the share for $1.50. So Person B get to pocket $0.40? Because the stock sold for $1.50, which was being traded for $1 at the time, and they have to pay the borrowing fee of $0.10? 

What happens to the stock? Surely someone bought it and is now the new owner, so Person A loaned the stock knew that they would basically be selling it if they decided to loan it to Person B?</text>

Also, if you "lend" your stock out, isn't this a sign you shouldn't keep that stock anymore? Is there another reason to lend out stocks? Otherwise, if someone were to want to borrow your stock to short it, I'd be like "this stock is going down. Better get rid of it...</text>

    <text>A squeeze is when the people with the short position are forced to buy the stock back. See, they borrow the stock, they don’t own it. When the price goes up, the people they lent the stock have doubts that the borrower can buy it back because they won’t have enough money if it keeps going higher, so the people that loaned the stock put out a call that everyone needs to give them their stock back. The only way to give them their stock back is to buy it at current market prices.</text>

    <text>Yes, I understand the situation. But it's a bit of a fairy tale to believe that everyone will hold onto their positions and then all cash out at the expense of hedge funds trying to close out short positions.

The reality is that many people are profiting because they have already purchased call options and are banking on the price being kept artificially high.

In a traditional pump and dump scam, you create demand for the stock by misleading people about the company merits. In this scheme, people are being incentivized to purchase based on the rumor that the price must go up because of the short positions that must be closed out. In reality the hedge funds may very well suffer losses, but so will many of the "main street" people who didn't get out in time.</text>

    <text>I’m not really sure what’s going on with the market manipulation angle... I’m not that versed in it and it’s a little fatiguing following this whole debacle... 

6 hours ago the stock topped out at 469 USD/share. It’s now trading for under $200...

But yes, that’s the gist of it. (Your example). So, from my limited understanding. Not only hold the stock you own, but make sure that you place an order for sale at an unreasonable amount (ie. a price that makes it impossible to recoup losses) so that it limits the amount of stock that can be bought for shorting purposes: in this scenario, not only is the stock increasing and causing mounting losses, bigger brokers can’t find more to cover the gap when it eventually crashes back down to earth.

So for you, the gamble is $500, and if there are 2 million other people like you, then that’s a lot of value. On the hedge fund side, the pressure mounts when you’re looking down the barrel of hundreds of millions of dollars lost for a few select clients

Edit:
&gt; looking at an indefinitely increasing loss

It’s only indefinite insofar as they want to play the game. Eventually the hope is that they cut their losses and sell, losing value in a pumped market. Once they sell, then the little guys can sell as the purge is on and hopefully make a tidy sum.</text>

    <text>Again, it's the options market that's driving the stock price. Options expire Friday, and if GME ends up over $150, some of the hedgies will go bankrupt, not because they have to close out their stock shorts, but because they have to settle in cash or stock, their uncovered call options. That's what going to kill them because they won't have the cash to cover the options bill. After paying what they can, they won't have the collateral to keep their shorts open, so they'll be forced to close those as well. 

Just to get an idea of the numbers: there are over 10,000 open contracts with strike prices between 50 and 60 (the stock is $200). Each contract is a 100 shares, so that's a million shares @$55 average strike. The hedgies are losing ~$145 million just on the options between $50-60. The 12,000 open contracts at $115 are costing them another ~$100 million. Pretty soon, we'll be talking about real money. 

If GME were to rise to even $300 tomorrow, I don't see how the hedgies can hang on except by having the machines turned off.</text>

    <text>Someone here mentioned u/Deepfuckingvalue, he specifically made Millions off of buying 750k worth of shares, so a couple thousand shares. Thing is, the Stock market works better and better the more stocks you buy, and that 10x difference gets bigger. 
By a lot. u/Deepfuckingvalue for instance, put in 750,000, and has made (as of now) 32.25 million dollars. Secondly, this was a collaborative effort by r/wallstreetbets to make the stock price go up and make it more valuble. So, the entire purpose of this operation was to make the stock price higher than ever before. But yeah, it was a combo of 1. The more you buy, the higher your earnings get. 2. Everyone bought stock at once collectively, jamming up the price. (That second one is oversimplified, r/wallstreetbets has a mod post on the full details if you're interested)</text>

    <text>So in your example, Eric could be someone on WSB using Robinhood. I'm just trying to make sure I understand.

A - D are all short, like that is what's in it for them. So I guess I'm wondering if this is something that happens between daytraders a lot and Eric could just be a lousy daytrader. I get that if the stock gets pushed up like GME, Eric could make a lot. But he could also lose his investment when the stock goes down, in which case then A - D make money?

Again I'm not even trying to argue, I just don't understand fully. Where is the person who loses in this picture?</text>

Are the computers literally just generating thousands of legal contracts every second (like, real paper trail PDFs) with all of the right parameters/fields filled in?

    <text>I sadly agree with you. As we saw today, the billionaires can change the rules when it suits them.

I expect that when the day of reckoning finally arrives, retail investors will be locked out of their accounts, like they were both today and yesterday, while the shorts clear at reasonable prices. The price will plummet, and anybody who bought in near the peak will be fucked.

I hope new laws and regulations are put in place to prevent such abusive shorting. But I doubt that will make any retail investors with losses feel better.</text>

    <text>Correct.  This particular issue has never happened before, so there’s gonna be court cases and possibly a  congressional hearing about it, but the general consensus seems to be that the hedge funds and brokers decided that the fines they’d have to pay if their forced stop is found to be illegal is worth it to stop hemorrhaging money at the rate they were posting it.

Note that hedge funds and investment companies do this shit to each other all the time, and it’s only suddenly a huge issue and needs to be addressed now that the plebeians have managed to outplay the 1%, and the 1% just broke the rules to try and delay the damage.</text>

    <text>I think I got it now! I just am unsure if that mathematically would be a shorting of 200%? Also, if your dad's barber sold it to his wife (meaning she didn't owe anything) would the shorting now be 200% because the 10 pens are owed when there's only 5, or would that be 300% because 15 pens are needed (10 owed to me and your dad, and 5 that the barber's wife is in possession of)?</text>

    <text>They're companies where I believe in the tech and they won't be running out of cash soon.  I'm betting the tech works. Shorts are betting it won't.  Fair enough.

The only way the shorts hurt my investment is if my company needs $$ but the low stock price hurts their ability to raise $$.  Which is why I look for well funded companies.

EDIT: Here's an example.

Citron Research, a group associated with the GME short sellers, shorted a company called Enphase.  They published this report about Enphase after they shorted:

https://citronresearch.com/citron-reports-on-enphase-and-solaredge-generac-has-just-crashed-your-honeymoon/

The stock dropped after the report.  IIRC, it went from 20 to 8 or something.  I didn't care.  I liked the company.  

Now, Enphase trades at $198 or so.  Stock ticker is ENPH.</text>

    <text>Yes technically that would work but the main problem here is the sheer scale of what’s happened.  The stock was shorted *140%* (some reports have it shorted even higher).  There aren’t that many shares in existence (there aren’t even 100% since the GameStop ownership owns shares as well).  Every trade is a loss at this point.  

Think of it this way:  I borrowed 1 million shares from you to sell for 10$ each (10 million made).  Each share is now 300$.  If I buy you 1,000 shares at 300$ (for $300,000), the price then drops to 295$.  I still owe you 990,000 shares... and the price isn’t going down...

Edit: Regardless of who they buy from, the shares still have to be *bought*.</text>

    <text>Hey, I think this did it for me. If the hedge fund needs the stock back, they'll have to pay what is worth, regardless of what they originally paid, because that's the price. And that's the price because there's more factors than just the profitability of the company.

    <text>No, not in your example.  In your example, there isn't a market (in the tradeable sense), only a direct payment for perishable goods rendered.

In that example, let's say the $0.50 it takes to make lemonade consists of $0.49 worth of lemons, and $0.01 worth of water.  Let's also assume you purchase lemons in large bulk.

If you had a reason to suspect the price of lemons was going to do down, you might opt to sell some of your lemon stock at today's price with the intention of re-purchasing the lemons later when you actually need them.

If you were right, and the price of lemons went down, you could pocket the difference in price as profit, while still selling lemonade.  If you were wrong, you would lose money having to re-purchase lemons at a higher price then what you originally paid for them.</text>

    <text>&gt; GameStop is going out of business and hedge funds took a financial position that reflected that reality.

Hedge funds took *much* too extreme of a financial position. Shorting a stock that already has short interest over 100% is widely irresponsible.

What retail investors did wouldn't be possible without that sort of crazy short interest.</text>

    <text>I still don’t quite get the idea of borrowing stocks. In my mind, it’d made sense to just not buy back the stocks once they shot up. So these hedge funds, after selling, just shouldn’t buy back because they’d be doing so at a loss. The way you explain it though, it sounds like they were obligated to buy back, which is a concept I don’t really get.

I assume the video you shared with me will go over that though, and I’m content to just wait to understand this part of it until later. Thanks for taking the time to explain things to me!</text>

    <text>My point is that no company netting $300k/year is going to spend what it costs to IPO.  Buying stock is buying partial ownership.  If you issue 100 stocks and I buy 51 of them, I’m a majority shareholder and when the board votes on anything, my vote counts more than everyone else’s combined, so I essentially get to say what does or doesn’t happen.  If the company makes money, I make money.  If the company loses money, I lose money.  Granted, that’s how it’s supposed to work, not really how it does work.  These days it’s almost just a game of speculation and manipulation.  If I have enough money I can buy a chunk of stock, let it go up, tell other people it’s a good investment because it’s going up, buy more chunks here and there, then sell some, let it go down, rebuy, rinse and repeat....and make a fortune.  That’s why everyone’s flipping out right now, because these hedge funds have been doing that forever, screwing over the people who bought in too late. With GME, citadel made a bet they got locked into and a shitload of people bet against them and won.  Citadel got mad they lost control and strong armed trading companies into doing their damage control.  Citadel, Robinhood, CNBC, and a few others are about to get sued into oblivion for blatantly illegal market manipulation.  And I’m totally ok with that because they’re a bunch of whiny little bullying assholes that finally got beat at their own game and are throwing a temper tantrum</text>

    <text>Ok fine, he hasn’t dumped yet. But do you honestly think anyone believes GME is worth anything? No. But buying up a massive quantity of a failing company and then going online and convincing others to do the same is manipulation of the markets. I’d wager that’s the real reason he hasn’t sold, because as soon as he does, he will have profited from market manipulation which puts him at serious risk of jail time. In this scenario, both sides are technically wrong, in the sense that two wrongs don’t make a right. I agree fuck the naked shorts, but god help anyone that sells GME and makes millions.</text>

    <text>from what I understood they were one of the "leaders" of the reddit coordination to buy and hold the gamestop-stocks. and because they went in early (and hard), their shares were worth some 20+ million at times but they still held true to their plan to hold and not sell, to screw over the hedgefunds instead of making huge bank themselves, which brought them the admiration of many others.

but this is all just 2nd-hand information, so take it with a grain of salt, someone else might be able to shed more light on this</text>

    <text>Yes and no. To simplify things there is only 100% of the company to sell so in issuing more shares they are literally giving up or selling part of the company. It doesn't matter as long as you have controlling interest then the company is still yours so in the example of there are only 100 shares, if I own 60 I could "issue" more stock and sell another 9 before I lose controlling interest.</text>

    <text>Right, but there are just under 70 million outstanding shares. Only 39% of that is float. That means about 27 million shares are float. 

If there’s 100,000 call options that end ITM, then that’s 10 million shares. If this short squeeze doesn’t happen, there’s a good chance that a gamma squeeze could cause the price to soar until others holding decide to sell, which is the same situation that the short squeeze would put us in. 

It literally had the potential to just never stop, unless they just stop selling options altogether.</text>

    <text>Haha hell yeah. Question: how high do you think this squeeze can go? Or is there a projection? I heard people saying the 400/500 was great enough to sell at (obviously fantastic from the 100s) but if the hedge people get as desperate as it seems they're going to be, can't this explode even higher? 

Or is there no projection, but this concept is the reason people are holding so long to ride it out and see where this thing goes

I'm sorry for so many questions. This is exciting when it all starts to make sense lol</text>

    <text>Latest daily report on short interest (% of short volume vs float) today at closing was 123%.  Doen from 140%ish, but still massive and nowhere close to enough.

Days to cover for GME on those shorts are 6 days.  Meaning it would take literally *all* of average daily market trading volume 6 days to fulfill the shorts.

I really don’t understand how this will be resolved, other than the shorters going under and liquifying all their assets to pay liabilities, which will shake the market, but which way, I’m not sure.  If it does work out this way, retail investors, your everyday Americans, will have a whole lot money to play around with.</text>

    <text>Exactly - that’s why it’s a game of chicken. If I’m long, I don’t have any holding costs, but if any of the other longs decides to cash in, it could let shorts close out their position and potentially relieve some of the pressure.

If I’m short, well gotta keep paying that interest and hope I can hold out...</text>

    <text>&gt;On the other hand, the longs are literally just buying and holding stock.

The longs are also outwaiting other longs. Everyone who bought while GME went up is at the risk of losing the investment when the price drops, so they'd have to sell before the other WSB investors sell. Everyone who didn't get in at the bottom is at risk of losing.</text>

    <text>Very important to note: if a shorted stock loses 95% of it’s value, it’s a 95% return, not 20x (which translates to 2000% return). A short position has a maximum gain potential of 100%, and “infinite” loss potential, just the opposite of regular long positions.</text>

    <text>Yes, they'll need to find someone willing to sell so that they can return the loan.

If no one is willing to sell like the 💎👐 at WSB? Well, then they need to offer higher and higher prices until someone is willing to sell.

Why not wait it out until prices drop again? Well, because they're paying interest on the loaned stock so the longer they wait, the more money they lose.</text>

    <text>What you describe in the first paragraph is basically how a short sale works.

Brokers want to lend shares because they can charge interest and make money on shares that would otherwise just be sitting in client accounts.</text>

    <text>The brokers what to lend shares because when you’re shorting a stock you also have to pay interest to have a position in the short. These brokers are getting a ton of money from the interest because the funds can have their position open essentially indefinitely (unless stated otherwise in the contract) 

It becomes a problem when the brokers think that the funds won’t have enough capital to cover their loan. If you think about it a short position has infinite loss potential. You could take out a loan when the share price was $5 and it could theoretically go up forever. The brokers doesn’t want to not get paid back and they can margin call whatever fund took out the short forcing them to payback the loan at whatever current price the shares are at (in the case of GME),wayyyyy above what they starting shorting it at. If you don’t have enough money to pay it back your short the fund is now bankrupt and the brokers are on the hook for the lended out shares.</text>

    <text>That’s pretty much it.

Another reason you might want to borrow shares is because you need to cover against settlement failure - you need to deliver securities to someone but shares you were expecting aren’t immediately available so you  go out and borrow them for your trade and repay them when your expected securities arrive.</text>

    <text>I’m going to be upfront - I don’t know how it works with TD Ameritrade specifically.  Some brokerages don’t pay the account owners directly, but they may charge you lower fees than they would have if they couldn’t do this. I think other brokerages actually do pay you directly if they lend out your shares in this manner.</text>

    <text>So let's say 5 people have 100 shares each in a company, and they keep them all with a broker as someone who handles the buying and selling for this 5 people. The broker now has 500 shares to lend to you to sell, as long as you give them money up front and promise to buy them back as they need to give them back to the 5 people who own them. Technically the actual owners usually don't even know they are gone, only the broker does.</text>

    <text>&gt;Person B actually comes in and sells the share for $1.50.

How did Person B sell the share for $1.50 if it's currently being traded for $1?

I'll try to simplify it as much as possible.

Person A has one share of stock that trades at $1.

Person B has no shares, but thinks the stock will decrease in value, so Person B sells the share that belongs to Person A to Person C for $1.

Now Person B has $1 and owns no shares, **but they owe Person A a share.** (There's no actual borrowing. For all intents and purposes, Person A still "owns" the share. They could sell the share to Person D, and then Person B would have to "return" the stock to Person D instead.)

If the stock price goes down to $0.50, person B can spend $0.50 to buy the share and return it to person A. Person B profits $0.50 in that scenario. 

If the stock goes up to $2, person B has to spend $2 to buy the share and return it to person A. Person B loses $1 in that scenario.</text>

    <text>It would be more like:  


The Widgets company is currently trading for $100/share

Ya Boy has a share in the Widgets company because he thinks widgets are the Next Big Thing and that the stock will go up.

The Dude is really down on Widgets and thinks they are on their way out and the stock will go down. The Dude pays $10/month to Ya Boy to borrow his stock and then sells it immediately for its current price of $100.

One month goes by and The Dude was right: widget stock is now only worth $20 each. The Dude buys 1 share, gives it back to Ya Boy and gets to keep the $80 difference between the sell and buy price (minus the $10 he paid to borrow it).

Let's flip it: one month later, Widget stock is up to $200!! The Dude faces a dilemma. He can keep paying $10/month, hoping the stock comes back down or he can cut his losses and buy the stock at a loss.</text>

    <text>Well, it would be kind of weird, but it could be done with a house. 

Let’s say the housing market was way up, and you were expecting it to crash soon. So you tell your friend, hey give me your house and let me sell it, and I’ll buy you the exact same house in 6 months. 

You offer to pay your friend $X a week, and let him live with you (so that’s his incentive to do this) until you replace his house. 

You sell the house, in 6 months the market has dipped way down and you buy his house back (or one just like it) and pocket the profit.

So you’re not selling something that isn’t yours, nor are you stealing anything or ripping anyone off. Everyone involved is a consenting party. Where it gets sketchy is when big companies with a TON of money start doing this and then manipulate the price of houses in your area, or they do this so many times that they actually OWE more houses (to repay people back with) than there are houses available. Which is what happened with GME, because it was shorted 140%. That’s not really supposed to happen, I think there are laws that try to mitigate the risk of that happening, but I’m not totally sure how they all work, financial regulations are hundreds of thousands of pages of really boring shit.</text>

    <text>But... does it affect our lives, really? If you jump in on this Gamestop thing, sure, you can get burned (though converse you can make money) - but nobody is demanding you do that. You are free to ignore what is going on with GME, in which case you won't be meaningfully affected.</text>

    <text>Basically the short seller is taking all the risk, for a potential big reward or loss. The one who is loaning the shares is taking almost no risk at all (because they know the situation and can ask for the shares back at any time) for a small guaranteed reward. Investment is like this, always trading off risk and reward and both sides can win depending on their situation. 

So, you may not find it palatable but for a lot of people this is no more strange than paying for groceries by tapping some plastic or buying a house with the money the bank pulled out of someone else’s savings account.</text>

    <text>When the system works, short selling balances out the market. Some investors lose, but others win. Those who have the foresight to understand how the market is going to move are rewarded with more funds to make more guesses about how the market will move.

That said, it's definitely open for abuse. It's a very risky practice, and it can undermine the reputation of an otherwise decent company.</text>

    <text>Stocks don't inherently represent the success of a company and a company really has no stake in its own stocks financially (though if they have a board of directors, being able to buy back stocks and control who is on the board might be important).

The reality is that the "financial industry" makes money off of betting on or outright manipulating the value of stocks.</text>

    <text>Sorry, basically none of those come close imo. Performance, range ect.

The Audi is the only one of the list I would say has some clout. 

Seriously, the Jag? That is the biggest pos out there. 

Either way, besides the point. A car is a car, is ford or chevy better is your point. My point is all the other tech Tesla leads in that basically no one is close to. 

Tesla is a tech/manufacturing company, not a car company. No one else on your list (from my knowledge) has space engineers helping to design their product. That's why they have the stock price they do. 

Their cars a great, but not that great, their tech on the other hand, is what justifies the stock to me.</text>

    <text>Yeah I don't buy the whole argument that they have to buy the stock back so the loss is uncapped.. etc.. Usually the agreement would include some sort of collateral so if they can't get the stock they will have to pay up the collateral. It's really no different from me not being to make my car payment, I will lose my car.. but not my house and bank account.</text>

    <text>I don't actually know sorry, but presumably hedge funds would have a general contract between the companies they work for? Something like "ABC company agrees to lend DEF Hedge fund any and all stocks we own upon request, persuant to a flat fee per stock of 3% (or whatever) of the stocks current price, with xyz required in collateral". And then you can turn that into a protected spreadsheet connected to the stock exchange, the company database, the hedge fund portfolio, etc etc. Kind of like how when you agree to a EULA or terms and conditions policy, you're technically agreeing to sign a contract - just in this case the contract is between two (or more I suppose) companies and the database is just a representation of that contract's intention. 
I'm not an economist, lawyer or stock market guy, so this is all educated guessing.</text>

    <text>Okay but what’s your point? The day they release their earnings and show that, in fact, they’re not the worst team in the league and prove every analyst wrong, the stock will rise, probably higher than before the short

Valuable companies don’t fail because their stock price hit 0. If someone somehow managed to manipulate the market to make apple hit $1 would Apple go bust? No of course it wouldn’t because Apple still makes hella money.

    <text>Volatility like this is largely caused by a high number of trades happening on a particular stock.

It may not be that other hedge funds didn't see markers. Most professionals would likely have agreed that GameStop was going to drop. Knowing that Melvin Capital was so deeply shorted *may* have left others avoiding it.

The individual traders coordinating sparked the unexpected increase in the stock that other hedge funds almost certainly took advantage of.</text>

    <text>The thing is that you buy his shares, return them to your lender, and your lender then decides to sell those to the market because they think GameStop is overvalued or whatever. And you buy those back, return them to someone else who also decides to sell- the price will probably still be creeping up along the way, but this goes on until the squeeze is over and the people refusing to sell for less than 10k or whatever are screwed.</text>

Worst-case scenario, this will delay the ultimate demise of Gamestop by some time.</text>

    <text>I think the reality is that the public has very limited knowledge on how financials actually work and just simply accepting it as a premise that the institutions \*ONLY\* make decisions to screw normal people is absurd. I'm the first person to stand up to address wealth inequality and to enforce stronger market regulations.

But it is humorous to me to see people complain about how the market supposedly isn't a free market, despite the quagmire of regulations regarding financials that they probably simultaneously champion. It's a really, really cute thought.

Simply being angry and posturing against "the man" doesn't make you right. There is a reason Robinhood restricted the asset, and it's not to protect "that one billionaire hedge fund". Do you think Robinhood, Interactive Brokers, Merrill Lynch, etc all conspired together to protect that one hedge fund? Or do you think there's a systemic risk inherent to the GME stock that the brokerage firms are now engaged in and have deemed it unsustainable to overleverage?</text>

    <text>Ok now I get your question better, sorry. A short seller is basically saying the company is destroying value. A short sale is a way for an investor to make money if his thesis is correct.

People might sell a stock even if there is a large short is on because they agree that the price is likely to go down in the future so they want to sell now and limit future losses. They might have also bought shares in the past at a lower price and want to realize some of those gains. 

What’s happening at GameSpot is a bit unusual because the short position is so big.</text>

    <text>I can't stress enough the bank-lender analogy from before. If you offer a series of products for your customers and one of your products ends up actually costing you a ton of money, if you tell your customers that you're no longer offering that product, is that criminal? How dare you protect the interests of your business!

Robinhood wants to provide its users as much access to products as possible, but in this case GME is posing a risk to the business that they can't sustain. It's unfortunate in the eyes of those who seemed to be making meteoric gains from the stock, but it was driving Robinhood into insolvency. That doesn't mean they are corrupt or deserve jail time. Again: is the banker corrupt for not lending out all of his money for any scheme you propose?</text>

I said WSB functioned as a "quasi-hedge fund in it's \[sic\] own way". "quasi" being the operative word. Of course a Reddit forum is not a hedge fund. Great job Socrates.

In fact, for someone who so clearly identifies these falsehoods, exactly what is preventing me from executing the same logical equivalence in identifying you as an industry insider? Clearly you know way more than me and have done much to dismantle my arguments. I think it is you who have special interests in financials that you are failing to disclose!

Let it be known, after all this, that I am also the one accused of fallacies and strawmans, as though my status as an insider or not bears any merit towards the veracity in studying the function and utility of restricting assets on a trading platform.

Honestly man. I don't even know what stake you get out of this. Like, if you were a Trump supporter and we were arguing politics, I could at least suspect maybe you were a Russian bot and it would make sense, but I genuinely have no idea what exactly you're fighting for here. Preventing the "slandering of WSB"?? Lol...?</text>

    <text>Robinhood is simply a trading platform. They did absolutely nothing wrong. It is entirely at the discretion of the brokerage firm on what assets they allow investors to trade.

In this case, Robinhood is protecting their firm against the massive risk created in allowing current securities trading with GME and other stocks. Some of this risk is just a result of natural industry-wide blackouts. The trading volumes occurring right now are actually causing stocks to emerge on portfolios without any settlement or market execution. The system is simply overwhelmed and the data pipelines are failing.

Second, Robinhood can no longer overleverage their own balance sheet by hedging against the options contracts engaged with this stock. As a result, they are now borrowing hundreds of millions of dollars simply to meet their capital requirements via FINRA. Robinhood is more of a bystander than some sinister player working to oil the wheels of Wall Street, whatever that even means.</text>

You seem to indicate that they "took much too extreme of a financial position" indicating some level of unacceptable severity, so there may be some interpretation on who deems it acceptable or unacceptable. I don't really have a comment on that aspect, however.</text>

The rest of my comment was unsolicited advice. Gotta be careful because you can lose a lot of money in the stock market. Even "measure twice, cut once" doesn't always work.</text>

    <text>Okay mate, listen.
I bought 6 shares only, when it was (35$ per share) it was all I could afford.
I made 2000$ profit. I cashed out 1500$ because I needed it and the other 500$ is still in.
The price is at 400$ again now (check FRA Germany stock market).

I am still at 2000$+ profit and I dont care if I lose this 500$.
I just tell you the short squeeze is going to happen, you shouldnt have used margin and it is not too late to buy in again, many brokers allow it. Stop throwing with assumptions.

Take your own risk though.</text>

If you can understand the lingo in this video today, Melvin and brokerages are fucked as GME prices increase. They cant cover, got caught with their pants down.

The first two minutes of the video is our thread back and forth where buyers and sellers trade "10-15 billion dollar loss/gain on each side"

at 3 minute mark, 'are you protecting the market or customers?' They are changing the rules to get off the hook

Demand for GME stock is insane and they want to stop buying of the stock

    <text>You're missing a key point. To use your example of the 10 million shares owed for the ITM calls 9 million or so have ALREADY been purchased. The MM's have them on hand already to deliver. That means they only need to buy a million shares. There's no unlimited pressure, they buy what they need to fill the remainder of the order. In fact, a lot of market activity is likely MM repositioning there reserves - buying and selling there holdings to balance there position so that when they fork the stock over to you they are not losing money. Nothing is static or happens in a vacuum.</text>

    <text>&gt;how high do you think this squeeze can go

Theoretically infinite, if people hold onto the stocks they bought. We have no idea where it could end, wherever individual people decide that they're taking their money and going home.

For reference, I bought 3 shares at $293 a piece on Wednesday. When I woke up in the middle of Thursday to see the price at $120 I didn't even flinch. It's going way higher I bet.

Unless the hedge funds, brokers, and clearing houses get even more drastic with illegal practices like they started to today. Don't listen to me because I'm a moron and know nothing about finance, but what happened today will become THE case study in market manipulation.</text>

    <text>I think it's determined on how large the initial position was. So If I were to take a short position of $100 of GME shares I would have to pay interest on those $100 as long as the short position is in place.</text>

    <text>&gt; if any of the other longs decides to cash in, it could let shorts close out their position and potentially relieve some of the pressure

But isn't the amount of shorted stock greater than the total amount of stock available?  I was under the impression that even if some of the longs closed, there still wouldn't be enough shares available to close the shorted positions.</text>

    <text>When these hedge funds are required to buy back shares, who do they buy from? Would that not require someone wanting to sell to them? If I bought shares last week, could I be forced to sell to one of these hedge funds that are required to buy back? I'm reading some places that Robinhood is forcing people to sell, so I assume that's the reason? But I have no clue, I'm learning a shitload just like most of us.</text>

    <text>This explains why RH halted trading GME to scare people into selling, and in turn lowered the stock, which allowed these firms to purchase a bunch of stock at a much lower amount. Now that I know how short sales work, I realize how fucking corrupt today was. Geez. I’m glad I bought 2 shares of GME today. I’m hoping the same happens to the AMC stock I purchased today.</text>

    <text>But then Person F comes in and buys the stock People A through E artificially lowered, and People A through E are pissed because their market manipulation backfired.

And so the brokerage, in an attempt to appease the hedge fund, fucks Person F by blocking their trades and even forcing them to sell their stocks.</text>

    <text>Thank you for responding to my question. TD was just a for instance. 

I have another question. 

So do brokerage firms initially buy and keep the shares and offer them to individuals? Like TDA bought 103753 shares of BCB. They paid BCB directly. So then TDA now has 103753 shares and offers them at market value to individuals. Although now that I've written this out, I can't see the immediate incentive of this. 

Or do individuals just use the brokerage firms to negotiate the rules of trading. Like how someone can represent themselves in court but they don't actually know the specifics of the process or jargon so it's better to use a lawyer.</text>

    <text>I'd been under the impression this getting against companies an masse, especially against self-owned stocks, was enough to drive companies under. That could very well be wrong, though.
Maybe shorting also didn't contribute to the 2007 recession? Again, I'd thought it did, and if so, you know, that affected a lot of people.</text>

    <text>I entered the spez. I called out to try and find anybody. I was met with a wave of silence. I had never been here before but I knew the way to the nearest exit. I started to run. As I did, I looked to my right. I saw the door to a room, the handle was a big metal thing that seemed to jut out of the wall. The door looked old and rusted. I tried to open it and it wouldn't budge. I tried to pull the handle harder, but it wouldn't give. I tried to turn it clockwise and then anti-clockwise and then back to clockwise again but the handle didn't move. I heard a faint buzzing noise from the door, it almost sounded like a zap of electricity. I held onto the handle with all my might but nothing happened. I let go and ran to find the nearest exit.
I had thought I was in the clear but then I heard the noise again. It was similar to that of a taser but this time I was able to look back to see what was happening.
The handle was jutting out of the wall, no longer connected to the rest of the door. The door was spinning slightly, dust falling off of it as it did. Then there was a blinding flash of white light and I felt the floor against my back.
I opened my eyes, hoping to see something else. All I saw was darkness. My hands were in my face and I couldn't tell if they were there or not. I heard a faint buzzing noise again. It was the same as before and it seemed to be coming from all around me. I put my hands on the floor and tried to move but couldn't.
I then heard another voice. It was quiet and soft but still loud.
"Help."

    <text>Awesome explanation, helps to understand what the hell was going on (and, specifically, I also didn't understand how the hedge fund could short the stocks by 140% and now I do), so thank you.

One thing I'm curious on is whether there's any risk to Eric in this situation, and to what degree if there is? Let's say Eric happened to have $1000 sat about and bought a bunch of shares before this all properly kicked off, those shares would be worth significantly more now (presumably millions at this point). Could Eric get into a situation where they lose their initial $1000 investment? I'm imagining that for that to happen they would have to hold onto the shares and the price would have to drop below what they originally paid, right?</text>

    <text>It's a 30 min video and you responded after 6 mins, so I guess you didn't watch it. I encourage you to do so before judging. 

On the contrary, having a realistic understanding of the complex and real challenges that face our society is anything but unproductive. What is unproductive is ignoring a problem and pretending it doesn't exist. I'm not being pessimistic, I'm looking at things based on our scientific understanding of what is happening to the biosphere which is not a moral position. I'm not saying the glass is half empty, I'm pointing out the reality that the glass is on fire. We could solve many of the issues facing us if we degrow to a level of ecological use that is sustainable. Obviously capitalism which depends upon growth is not a viable system for such a society.

    <text>This is more to confirm my suspicion, but please correct me if I’m wrong:

If market makers move to hedge shares in preparation for the expiring calls that are ITM, but there are no available shares due to other investors accumulating all of them, will this gamma squeeze have the same consequences as a short squeeze but on a much larger scale? If the stockholders hold, the price would just keep going up, correct? And then when the shorts cover, it would go even higher.</text>

    <text>The HF's today seemed to be pulling out every stop to save themselves, up to pulling some of the most insane stunts the financial world has probably ever seen. Yes, it's a bubble. It'll pop. Yet they're still trying to come out ahead by shorting *more*. 

But clearly WSB and all the incoming players can remain "irrational" longer than these HF's, possibly even the brokers or the market can remain solvent. I don't see what that guy's strategy could possibly be at this point.</text>

    <text>Don't just watch. 

Sign up on Fidelity and buy a share. Doesn't have to be a full share of GME. BB, AMC, and others are in the same boat and much cheaper, possibly headed for the same trajectory. I didn't buy to make money. I simply bought to help fuck over shitty people. I'm super happy and up money.</text>

    <text>Short selling is controversial - so you’re hardly alone in thinking short selling is a pile of crap.

There is an argument that it improves market efficiency because it allows for better price discovery. It essentially adds more data points to the market since going short is just as much a call on the future prospects of a company as is going long. People making bets that company X is overvalued and the share price should fall is just as valuable or useful as people thinking company Y is undervalued.

The flip side of the argument is that short selling is predatory and difficult to regulate.</text>

    <text>There are some people - Elon Musk for example - who believe short selling should not be permitted. In a sense you’re right that shorting doesn’t really create value like investing in a promising company might. 

Shorting makes sense conceptually because every market participant implicitly declares they believe a stock is overvalued or undervalued by participating in buying or selling. If you think a stock is undervalued, you buy. If you think a stock you don’t own is overvalued, without shorting your only option is to not participate. By permitting shorting, the market rewards participants who “bet” correctly, even if their bet is focused on negative growth. Without shorting, there’s no mechanism to reward people/entities for correctly predicting a decrease in value. 

Here, the hedge funds’ “bear thesis” that a struggling brick and mortar franchise operating in an industry that is increasingly digital was honestly pretty sound (notwithstanding Ryan Cohen and others recently joining the board). The problem for the hedge funds was they overplayed their hand, which permitted the public to burn them on it. If the hedge funds didn’t short as much as they did, it’s likely few people would have noticed and we wouldn’t have seen this astronomical price inflation. 

This is not financial advice</text>

    <text>Well it’s intended to indicate the market losing confidence in a bad company. Yes, ‘a bad company’ would technically die on its a own, but shorting allowed people to know that this company might be involved in some shady shit for example, therefore telling investors to avoid it.
However, like everything on WallStreet, hedge funds get greedy and try to run struggling companies into the ground just so they can make a quick buck. Technically Melvin was reasonable to short GameStop, their business model is pretty bad, they were just overly greedy (140% short position) which is why they find themselves in this position</text>

    <text>Correct, it does require someone willing to sell it to them, and when they do find that person (hopefully) it's us. The idea is like a bubble or pyramid scheme, except by forcing the hedge fund's hand it's forcing *them* to be the bagholders at the top instead of a regular joe. It's essentially a name-your-price game, where you (and I, and all the other WSB users) name our prices, because they *have* to buy. Of course because a single share can change hands multiple times not every stock has to be sold at once, so if your name-your-price is 10x higher than every single other person it might get missed.

RH shouldn't be able to force you to sell.</text>

    <text>Based on accounts from others, that was certainly the goal of the restrictions implemented by Robinhood and other brokerages.

In actuality, it seems the scare largely didn't work and the price drop was instead a form of market manipulation whereby hedgefunds passed a handful of shares back and forth between themselves, making it look like there was a high sale volume and dropping the list price.

Since those who actually held shares didn't sell despite the scare, the markets avoided a full on liquidity collapse with the restrictions employed (because we couldn't buy while they tanked prices) but they're still due for a squeeze when it comes time to close their shorts.

Take all of that with a grain of salt, I'm just regurgitating what I've been able to piece together from other people talking about today's events.</text>

    <text>Think of it like this - lots of people want to buy and sell stocks (like you and I), but we each don’t have the resources to do it entirely on our own. Brokerage firms like TD Ameritrade provide the tools to let us buy and sell stocks as well as a way for us to store them securely.</text>

    <text>Brokerages can lend out shares that their clients own, like how a bank can lend out your money that you deposited. If you own stocks, some of them might be on loan RIGHT NOW.

This is a pretty safe bet for brokerages. The chance that everyone is going to try to sell all their stocks at one time is very low (especially because a lot of them are probably in retirement funds and whatnot).</text>

    <text>Now you understand! I sincerely suggest you watch the movie *Trading Places*. It's not technically accurate, but some of the descriptions are. At one point, after some commodity brokers explain their business to Billy Ray (Eddie Murphy), he exclaims "Y'all just a couple of bookies!" and the brokers look at each other "I told you he'd get it!". 

In the most famous scene, fortunes are made and lost in orange juice futures in one day. However, out in the real world, not one more, and not one less, orange was grown that day. Similarly, Gamestop is probably not selling any more or any fewer games because of this publicity. The actions in the markets are often only tangentially related to reality.</text>

    <text>Usually no. Most shorting is by really big players, big banks and hedge funds. They all "hedge" as the name implies. Hedging means to hold multiple seemingly conflicting positions to reduce risk. Gambling would be to YOLO all on one outcome, whereas hedging is to put multiple bets on multiple outcomes. For example, a hedge fund might short one retailer "Bad Inc" but go long on another retailer "Good Co." that they think is better off. Both stocks might go up or down, and often entire sectors move as one. The whole retail industry may suffer or rally and both Bad and Good may move together in the same direction. Since the fund holds both short and long positions simultaneously, they expect to win some and lose some regardless which direction the markets move. The idea is to pick the correct Goods and Bads to win more than they lose.</text>

    <text>It is not entirely unrelated. Lower stock price can make it harder for companies to raise capital, and selling stock (both short selling and the ordinary sell-what-you-own kind) can contribute to lower prices. Normally, this is a considered a good thing for price discovery; we WANT people who think a stock is overvalued to be able to bet against it, because that helps counteract bubbles and generally contributes to a better price. In practice, sometimes it doesn't work out that way and people end up doing unethical and illegal things with their positions instead - but that is true for people taking long positions as well. 

Re the 2007 recession, the main contributor was Credit Default Swaps (a considerably more complicated financial instrument than simply selling stock), as well as their mispricing by rating agencies as well as related issues.</text>

    <text>Squeeze it like a vise. Which is why they are all buying and holding, and why all these trading companies who are also in cahoots with these hedge funds are trying to prevent any buying (they don't want more Erics) and ONLY allow selling (they want Erics to sell so the price can go down by loosening supply or at least prevent it from going up further). 

Eventually the Alans have to buy, and they have to buy at whatever price the stock is at, in order to return the stock to B, C and Ds. So they are doing everything to cause the price to fall - fake news, causing hysterics, trying to bring the government in on false pretenses, on top of telling their friends at trading companies to forbid retail investor from buying, etc. Some of them are cracking on TV, and starting to say the quiet parts out loud - only we rich ratfuckers are allow to manipulate the market and you peasants should eat our turds. Billions of dollars are at stake, the kind of money people get murdered for, or jump off buildings. 

If this does not convinced anyone how fucking rigged the system is for the rich ratfuckers, then nothing else will. The fact that the people holding the stock could potentially lose money and they are still doing it shows that this has gone beyond some WSB "autists" seeing an opportunity to make a quick buck. This is now a full blown revolt against the powers that be, the institutional investors that routinely fuck everyone doing exactly this kind of shit. This is one of a lifetime chance to fuck with them by outplaying them at their own game, and the billionaires in these hedge funds are going bonkers. This is where it hurts them more than any protests ever will, or even voting can because it attack their pockets directly. And people are loving every minute of it.</text>

    <text>if Eric was the one owning all (or most) of the available shares, he could in principle set whatever price he wanted and make a ton of profit with little risk, because he'd have the leverage of Allan having no choice but to buy his shares. 

The risk in the situation we're dealing with is that there's 200 Erics, and the leverage is dependent on all of them refusing to sell below a certain price. If 100 Erics decide to sell and Allan gets his 100 shares, the remaining 100 Erics will lose most of their investment as the stock tanks to it's original low price (and even below).</text>

    <text>The idea is company A doesn't actually own any stocks. So it has to borrow shares from someone else.. It makes zero sense to continue to own a stock if you want to short it.  Since you are betting it to lose value, why would you keep it?

Also you are only going to make a profit by selling someone else's stock. Because you earn the difference when you give them back the stock that can be bought back at cheaper price.. And if the company goes bankrupt, you don't have to give them back the stock!.</text>

    <text>You're being quite unfair.

It does not change my position whether it's "one hedge fund" or "four hedge funds". Feel free to pick your own number. If you found offense with the characterization, then I feel you are cherry picking a distinctly insignificant item to the point of my message.

You accused me as being part of the system. Why? It's fine that you don't have to accept the premise that I put forth, I can safely assure you many others have adopted that premise whether they intended to or not. But somewhere you accepted an unstated premise that associated me as "part of the system". And now you've taken it further: I'm protecting a "CORRUPT" system. Assuming my responses are incorrect, what grounds do you have to justify the label of corruption in restricting GME trades? You have provided no evidence in doing so.

I will speak bluntly, only because it is clear that between the two of us, it is abundant that you have zero knowledge on financial instruments, otherwise you would have already demonstrated it instead of parroting strawmen accusations, but my prior statements are given to you as actual facts on how the market works. Read these words very carefully:

If the marketplace was simply all long calls made from cash accounts, then Robinhood's behavior would be criminal. But that is not the case, and I assume people think that's how the stock market works. Securities trading has very complex financial instruments that allow market actors to engage in different risk styles and these instruments now mean that the \*brokerage firms themselves\* are acquiring risk by offering these instruments. They are no longer passive players overseeing an operation. If we are going to endorse a financial system that allows these instruments, we MUST also support Robinhood's interest in meeting the FINRA capital requirements every night with the clearing houses. PLEASE read up on that final statement I made. This isn't some ruse to trick you into becoming a corporate shill, it's just simply how it works. If you are asking me to state the opposite of truth, I will not. Robinhood is not engaged in corrupt behavior.</text>

His statements aren't immediately obvious in what is happening because he's speaking as though his audience has some understanding of market operations, when many people just opened their first brokerage account this week!

The fact that the video received 36k upvotes as a claim of market manipulation further confirms the fatal misunderstanding.

Some of the best of them discovered this and shared the information and what it meant if the large portion of individuals that sub to wsb decided to buy and hold.

They acquired and analyzed information that is freely available to all to view. They talked openly about what could happen in a hypothetical. People used their own judgement to risk buying the stock and try to make a buck if it were to come to pass. It started to come to pass. Wall Street cries foul and literally locked the users out of their brokerages because they were getting beat at their own game when the little guys started talking and playing by their rules.

    <text>There is a missing component to this: margin calls.

When you short a stock you need to have the assets to cover the sale in the event the trade goes badly for you.  If the cost to cover uses up all of your "margin" (available money) then you will automatically be forced to cover and your broker can force liquidize all of your assets to make that happen.

tldr; If the gamma squeeze sends this to the moon, everyone with a short position could be FORCED to cover and shoot it further into infinity.  If the people shorting it can't pay even after all of their assets have been liquidized then the brokerage has to pay, and if they can't pay the banks have to.  The potential damage from this is so bad that you have brokers all around the world literally breaking the law and preventing buys because the prospect of being fined or going to jail is better than being completely wiped out.</text>

Showing quite the talent for false arguments.</text>

    <text>It's quite apparent you do feel those things quite strongly. Must be disconcerting with your ego so tied up in being the finance guy.

Emotions are fine. Projecting them on others is not. You may benefit from some professional counseling. Does your firm have an EAP program?</text>

    <text>So what happens if these people that borrowed shares can't pay for them to give them back? With the original example, person borrowed 10 shares at 20, sold them, price went to 400 and now they're 3,800 dollars in the hole. The people who has thousands of shares borrowed would owe that person millions. If they can't pay them back the shares, does the person they borrowed from just not get the money? Is there some sort of insurance? Or does the hedge fund just claim bankruptcy and start over?</text>

    <text>Yes, thank you. I’m aware of how short squeezes work, but at this point, the float is so small in comparison to the outstanding shares, that even a gamma squeeze could trigger the same price surge the short squeeze would cause. I just wanted to voice that and make sure I’m not thinking about the gamma squeeze incorrectly. 

And then, obviously, the gamma squeeze would cause the shorts to be margin called which would further skyrocket the price, if the market makers are even able to purchase those shares from everyone who’s holding them.</text>

    <text>Yeah, exactly like the other guy said. There were some people who had bought game stop stock on margin (borrowed money) and since it was RH’s money used to purchase the stock they had the right to sell it when the price crashed too far.

If you purchased the stock with your actual money and not on margin you should be fine</text>

    <text>Again. I don’t see what’s wrong with betting a company will fail. If you’re the company, change your actions if you don’t want to make mr hedge fund rich. If it speeds up the collapse then great, can rid the market of another dying stock.</text>

    <text>Hmm.

If I move on to respond to other site users, then you'll pursue me, harassing me. Even going so far as to down-vote every post you can find of mine, as though to exert some petty gesture to strike me even harder. To give your current endeavor even more purpose. Your failure to address \*literally\* anything I've said is a silent confirmation that you ultimately are forced to accept my claims until you can find evidence to assure you otherwise. In the meantime, you comfort yourself by just throwing a tantrum. Insisting everything otherwise.

In fact, I wager that should I leave this conversation right now, I will continue to live rent-free inside your head for the rest of the day or night. Maybe you'll even bookmark all of this so you can look back at it again the next week, or month, or even year. Scoff at what a goon I've been and how you truly stuck it to me. How's that, champ? Am I in the ballpark?

The delight that gives me, my now future haunting of your existence, surely far exceeds the punishment you inflicted with your downvotes, but perhaps not. Either way, counseling seems \*literally\* prescriptive for your obsessive issues with me. Your mentioning it is likely without coincidence.

Anyways, good luck man. As I already offered, you are free to teach me. Failure to do so just means you cannot offer me anything more.</text>

    <text>It seems like there may be self directed and non self directed 401Ks but this is just from my googling. Im not from the US. If you are putting money into it you may want to spend a day getting to know where your money is and what is happening to it. Just my 2c. I would be very uncomfortable not knowing what was happening to my money.</text>

    <text>Margin call. When a brokerage let's an investor trade on margin or in certain options eventually they require the investor to put in more money to cover the position against losses. If they can't DO that then the brokerage will force the position to close and they'll have to pick up the difference and I believe take it out of the hide of the trader by any possible means.

At this point things will go apeshit because the broker will just start selling your shit to cover your position to close it and the stock prices of a ton of stocks will probably fall slightly and gamestop will go bonkers as theres a buying frenzy.</text>

    <text>Gosh, projecting so hard. Lying about my actions. Projection again.

I'm serious. Call EAP and get counseling. It's part of your homework - your failure to notice I responded to your teaching request (after a handful of minutes) and jumping to claim  my "Failure to do so" just confirmed how much you need to put down Reddit and get help.

To be clear: Your "pursuit" and "down-vote every post" claims are false, matching so many prior false claims you have made. I have only ever replied to or voted on your posts in this specific ELI5 - and no, I haven't downvoted all of them even in this thread.</text>

    <text>Thanks! I'm also confused about what the lender is doing in all this. What kind of stocks are they looking to buy? If stocks that are probably going to drop in value are what get shorted, do they primarily buy those? How do they cut their eventual losses if those do do worse and the borrower returns all the now-worthless stock? Do they also buy stocks that will likely rise to compensate?</text>
